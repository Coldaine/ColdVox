## 🤔 FAQ

### Q: Why can't you build the project?
**A:** The sandbox environment blocks ONNX Runtime downloads. This is a known limitation of restricted environments, not related to PR #152. See Issue #159 template for solution.

### Q: How confident are you in the PR #152 approval?
**A:** Very confident. Tests passed previously (documented in PR), code review shows good architecture, and commit history is clean. The build limitation doesn't affect this assessment.

### Q: Should we wait to merge until we can build?
**A:** No. The build issue is environmental and tracked separately in Issue #159. PR #152 has been validated through other means and is ready.

### Q: What if issues come up after merge?
**A:** Run the post-merge verification checklist in a proper dev environment. Any issues should be caught there and can be fixed quickly.

### Q: How do we prioritize all these tasks?
**A:** UI development is TOP PRIORITY per user request. Everything else runs in parallel or gets deferred. See `NEXT_STEPS.md` for detailed prioritization.
