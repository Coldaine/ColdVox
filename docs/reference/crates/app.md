# crate: app (Index)

The application crate does not yet expose a README. Authoritative documentation should be added at [`crates/app/README.md`](../../../crates/app/README.md). Until then, use this index to navigate source entry points.

## Key Entry Points

- [`src/main.rs`](../../../crates/app/src/main.rs)
