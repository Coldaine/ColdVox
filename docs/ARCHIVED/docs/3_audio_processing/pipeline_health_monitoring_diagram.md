## What "Health" Means in This Context

In the context of the ColdVox audio pipeline, "health" refers to the operational status, performance characteristics, and reliability of individual components and the system as a whole. Health monitoring provides visibility into whether components are functioning correctly, performing within expected parameters, and maintaining reliable operation.

### Key Health Dimensions

1. **Operational Status**
   - Whether a component is running or stopped
   - If a component has started successfully or failed to initialize
   - The current state of a component (e.g., active, idle, error)

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Frame processing rates (how many audio frames are processed per second)
   - Buffer utilization (how much of available buffer space is being used)
   - Processing latency (time taken to process audio frames or events)
   - Throughput (number of events or frames processed in a given time period)

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - CPU usage by each component
   - Memory consumption and allocation patterns
   - I/O operations and their efficiency

4. **Error and Exception Rates**
   - Frequency of errors occurring in each component
   - Types of errors being encountered
   - Recovery success rates after errors

5. **Connectivity and Communication**
   - Status of connections between components
   - Event routing success rates
   - Channel subscriber counts and health

### Health Indicators

The following are specific health indicators monitored in the ColdVox pipeline:

- **VAD Processor Health**: Whether the VAD task spawned successfully, frame processing rate, memory usage
- **Event Fanout Health**: Channel health, event throughput, subscriber status, error rate
- **STT Processor Health**: Model status, buffer utilization, processing latency, transcript quality
- **TUI Dashboard Health**: Metrics collection status, UI responsiveness, event processing rate

### Health Scoring

Components can be assigned health scores based on a combination of these metrics:
- **Healthy**: All metrics within normal ranges, no errors
- **Degraded**: Some metrics outside normal ranges, intermittent errors
- **Critical**: Multiple metrics significantly outside normal ranges, frequent errors
- **Failed**: Component is not running or unable to perform its function

### Purpose of Health Monitoring

The primary purposes of monitoring pipeline health are:
1. **Early Problem Detection**: Identify issues before they cause complete failures
2. **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement
3. **Troubleshooting**: Provide detailed information for diagnosing issues
4. **Capacity Planning**: Understand resource utilization for scaling decisions
5. **System Reliability**: Ensure consistent operation of the audio pipeline

By implementing comprehensive health monitoring with appropriate logging, we gain visibility into the operational state of the ColdVox system, enabling proactive management and faster resolution of issues.
