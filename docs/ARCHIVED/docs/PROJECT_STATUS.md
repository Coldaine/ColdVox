# ColdVox Project Status

## Current Phase: STT Integration Enhancement

Most workspace refactoring is complete. The active focus is improving the STT layer (Vosk defaults, streaming behavior, and preparing for additional backends) and polishing textâ€‘injection ergonomics.

Note: The README status badge is manually maintained. When updating this phase, also update the badge in `README.md` to keep them in sync.

Platform scope (prototype): Linux only, specifically Nobara (KDE Plasma). Crossâ€‘platform goals remain, but validation and instructions currently assume this environment.

### Completed Work

#### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes âœ…
- Fixed audio capture watchdog stability
- Resolved frame processing issues
- Improved error handling and recovery

#### Phase 2: Ring Buffer Implementation âœ…
- Implemented lock-free SPSC ring buffer
- Improved backpressure handling
- Added comprehensive metrics and monitoring

#### Phase 3: Audio Pipeline Refactoring âœ…
- Centralized resampling in AudioChunker
- Separated capture from processing concerns
- Implemented proper stereo-to-mono conversion

#### Phase 4: Multi-Crate Workspace âœ…
- Split monolithic codebase into focused crates
- Established clear module boundaries
- Improved build times and testability

### Current Work

#### Phase 6: STT Integration Enhancement ðŸ”„
- Default Vosk integration with model autodetect in runtime
- Streaming transcription pipeline in place (partial/final events)
- CI E2E WAV test documented and runnable with vendored libvosk
- Prepare for multiâ€‘backend support (Whisper stub plugin present)

### Upcoming Work

#### Phase 7: GUI Development
- Design cross-platform GUI interface
- Implement configuration management
- Add real-time visualization

## Known Issues / Remaining Items

- Text injection: ATâ€‘SPI app identification fallback and regex caching optimizations are still TODOs
- Some platform-specific injection backends need broader testing across environments
- Whisper plugin is a stub (no functional transcription yet); multiâ€‘backend selection remains future work
- Documentation updates continue as crates evolve

## Recently Completed

#### Phase 5: Text Injection Unification âœ…
- Unified TextInjector to asyncâ€‘first design (`crates/coldvox-text-injection`)
- Consolidated injection strategies and fallback chaining
- Platform-aware backend selection wiring from the main app

#### Phase 4: Multi-Crate Workspace âœ…
- Split monolithic codebase into focused crates
- Established clear module boundaries
- Improved build times and testability
