| Area | Repo Finding (Evidence) | Proposed Action (Assistant) | Agent Assessment (Agree/Modify) | Agent Recommended Action | Rationale (1–3 sentences) | Risk Level (Low/Med/High) | Rollback Reference (Tag/Path) | Example Commands (1–3 lines max) |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Anchor Tag | Current branch: `copilot/cleanup-repo-structure` (2 commits); no existing anchor tags; main branch is `main` with history grafted at `af75f86` | Create annotated anchor tag `anchor/2025-10-11-pre-cleanup` with message "Pre-cleanup anchor of copilot/cleanup-repo-structure" | Agree | Create anchor tag `anchor/2025-10-11-pre-cleanup` on current HEAD (a670361) before any cleanup actions | Essential rollback point before destructive operations; allows recovery of current state if cleanup causes issues | Low | anchor/2025-10-11-pre-cleanup | `git tag -a anchor/2025-10-11-pre-cleanup a670361 -m "Pre-cleanup anchor of copilot/cleanup-repo-structure"` `git push origin anchor/2025-10-11-pre-cleanup` |
| Branches | Only 1 remote branch: `origin/copilot/cleanup-repo-structure` (current branch); no other branches detected beyond implicit `main` | Keep main; delete all other remote branches after converting historically valuable ones to tags | Modify | No action needed - only cleanup branch exists; main branch is implicit/default and should remain untouched | Single active branch with no merge history or unique commits to preserve; cleanup branch will be merged/deleted via normal PR workflow | Low | N/A (no branches to delete) | `# No branch cleanup needed - only one branch exists` |
| GitHub Actions | 6 workflow files: ci.yml (12K), ci-minimal.yml (5.9K), vosk-integration.yml, release.yml, runner-diagnostic.yml, runner-test.yml; documented in docs/self-hosted-runner-complete-setup.md as active/working | Delete .github/workflows/* (all workflows); recreate from scratch later | Modify | Archive workflows to `archive/2025-10-11/workflows/` instead of deletion; workflows appear active and documented for self-hosted runners | Workflows reference self-hosted runners and are documented; preserving allows restoration if needed; archiving is safer than deletion for documented infrastructure | Medium | archive/2025-10-11/workflows/ | `mkdir -p archive/2025-10-11/workflows/` `git mv .github/workflows/*.yml archive/2025-10-11/workflows/` |
| Documentation Noise | 43 markdown files in docs/; organized in subdirs: plans/ (152K, 6 files), research/ (124K, 7 files), reports/ (28K), review/ (24K); no .ai.md or checkpoint files found; root has CLAUDE.md (12K), PR_123_REVIEW.md (17K), VOSK_SETUP_VERIFICATION.md (5.7K), agents.md (2K) | Quarantine ambiguous docs to archive/2025-10-11/docs/; delete obvious noise files | Modify | Archive docs/plans/, docs/research/, docs/reports/, docs/review/ and root files PR_123_REVIEW.md, VOSK_SETUP_VERIFICATION.md, agents.md to `archive/2025-10-11/docs/`; keep docs/dev/, docs/architecture/, docs/adr/, docs/user/, CHANGELOG.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md | Plans/research/review dirs appear to be working documents not core docs; root review/verification files are point-in-time artifacts; preserving architecture/dev/adr/user as core docs | Low | archive/2025-10-11/docs/ | `mkdir -p archive/2025-10-11/docs/` `git mv docs/{plans,research,reports,review} archive/2025-10-11/docs/` `git mv PR_123_REVIEW.md VOSK_SETUP_VERIFICATION.md agents.md archive/2025-10-11/docs/` |
| Extraneous Files | Large files: models/ (Vosk 50MB+, intentionally vendored per .gitignore), crates/app/test_vad (binary); .claude/ dir with hooks exists; docs/plans/Testing/ subdirectory duplicates InjectionTest1008.md; no tmp/checkpoint/cache dirs found | Quarantine potentially useful files to archive/; hard-delete regenerable artifacts | Modify | Archive .claude/ and docs/plans/Testing/ to `archive/2025-10-11/extraneous/`; delete binary `crates/app/test_vad` (regenerable); keep models/ (intentionally vendored per ADR-0001) | .claude/ is IDE-specific config (low general value but preservable); docs/plans/Testing/ appears to be duplicate structure; test_vad is build artifact; models/ are intentional per docs/adr/0001 | Low | archive/2025-10-11/extraneous/ | `mkdir -p archive/2025-10-11/extraneous/` `git mv .claude docs/plans/Testing archive/2025-10-11/extraneous/` `git rm crates/app/test_vad` |
| Ignore Rules | Current .gitignore has logs/, tmp/, models/ (with exceptions), .coldvox/*, vendor/, but no .scratch/, *.ai.md, agent-notes/, *.checkpoint.* patterns | Add ignore patterns: .scratch/, **/*.ai.md, **/agent-notes/, **/tmp/, **/*.checkpoint.* | Agree | Add ignore patterns to .gitignore: `.scratch/`, `**/*.ai.md`, `**/agent-notes/`, `**/*.checkpoint.*`; note tmp/ already covered as `/tmp/` and `temp/` | Future-proofing against AI/agent output noise; .scratch/ provides designated location for tool outputs; no current violations but prevents future accumulation | Low | N/A (additive change) | `echo -e "\n# AI/Agent scratch outputs\n.scratch/\n**/*.ai.md\n**/agent-notes/\n**/*.checkpoint.*" >> .gitignore` |
| Guardrails | Remote is https://github.com/Coldaine/ColdVox; main branch protection unknown (requires GitHub API/UI check); no commit message conventions enforced in repo | Keep branch protection on main; use clear commit messages (chore: prefix); create GOALS.md at root | Agree | Maintain existing main branch protection (verify via GitHub settings); adopt conventional commit style for cleanup (chore: prefix); create GOALS.md outlining MVP goals and non-goals | Branch protection prevents accidental main corruption; conventional commits improve changelog generation; GOALS.md provides clear scope guidance for future work | Low | N/A (process/documentation) | `# Verify via GitHub: Settings → Branches → main protection rules` `git commit -m "chore: archive historical docs and workflows"` `# Create GOALS.md with MVP scope` |
