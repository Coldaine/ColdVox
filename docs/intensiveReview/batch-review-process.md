# Batch Review Process Outline

This document outlines an efficient process for reviewing the remaining 17 scripts in the ColdVox project using a grouped, templated approach (5 archived stubs deleted). The process leverages the [batch-review-template.md](batch-review-template.md) to maintain thoroughness while enabling comparative analysis and bulk document generation. Reviews will be generated as Markdown files in subdirectories under `docs/intensiveReview/` (e.g., `ci-cd-setup/`, `verification/`) for organization.

## Step 1: Grouping and Prioritization
Scripts are categorized into functional groups based on their role in the project. Prioritization follows criticality: CI/CD and setup scripts first (high impact on builds and environments), followed by verification (essential for integrity), monitoring (operational health), runtime/setup (execution support), and low-impact/archived last (minimal active use).

### Defined Groups (17 Scripts Total - 5 archived deleted)
1. **CI/CD and Setup (7 scripts - High Priority)**  
   - local_ci.sh (root: Local CI runner)  
   - setup_hooks.sh (root: Git hooks setup)  
   - ci/detect-qt6.sh (CI: Qt6 detection)  
   - ci/setup-vosk-cache.sh (CI: Vosk cache setup)  
   - ci/update-dependency-graphs.sh (CI: Dependency graphing)  
   - gpu-build-precommit.sh (root: Pre-commit GPU build)  
   - gpu-conditional-hook.sh (root: GPU conditional hook)  
   *Rationale:* Core to build pipelines, Vosk/STT integration, and automation; frequent execution.

2. **GPU Detection and Build (1 script - Medium Priority, grouped with CI for context)**  
   - detect-target-gpu.sh (root: GPU target detection)  
   *Note:* Small group; review comparatively with CI build hooks above if overlaps found.

3. **Verification (3 scripts - High Priority)**  
   - verify_libvosk.sh (root: Vosk library verification)  
   - verify_vosk_model.sh (root: Vosk model verification)  
   - verify-model-integrity.sh (root: Model integrity check)  
   *Rationale:* Critical for STT/VAD pipeline reliability and model security.

4. **Monitoring (2 scripts - Medium Priority)**  
   - performance_monitor.sh (root: Performance monitoring)  
   - runner_health_check.sh (root: Runner health check)  
   *Rationale:* Supports operational stability but less frequent than CI.

5. **Runtime and Setup (3 scripts - Medium Priority)**  
   - start-headless.sh (root: Headless startup)  
   - setup_text_injection.sh (root: Text injection setup)  
   - setup_vosk.rs (root: Vosk setup in Rust)  
   *Rationale:* Enables runtime features like injection and Vosk integration.

6. **Low-Impact Batch (1 script - Low Priority)**  
   - ci/guard_no_vad_demo.sh (CI: Simple guard for no-VAD demo; unimportant as it's a basic check with no complex logic)  
     
     
     
     
     
   *Rationale:* COMPLETED: Archived scripts deleted as they were non-executable stubs providing no value. guard_no_vad_demo.sh is a trivial guard script that provides CI value.

*Total: 7 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 17 scripts.*

## Step 2: Review Execution
- **Switch to Review Mode:** Use `switch_mode` to Orchestrator or a dedicated reviewer mode (e.g., Code mode for analysis) to implement reviews.
- **Batch Size:** Review 1-2 groups per operation to avoid overload; generate one Markdown file per group using the batch template.
- **Template Usage:** 
  - Read all scripts in a group using `read_file` (up to 5 at once).
  - Fill the [batch-review-template.md](batch-review-template.md) with group-level and individual assessments.
  - Emphasize comparative insights (e.g., "All verification scripts share similar error handling but differ in model paths").
  - Generate file: e.g., `docs/intensiveReview/ci-cd-setup/group-review.md` via `write_to_file`.
- **Efficiency Measures:**
  - Focus on critical aspects only (skip verbose code dumps; reference git history for archived).
  - For low-impact batch: Single file `docs/intensiveReview/low-impact/archived-and-guards-review.md` with brief pros/cons (e.g., "Pros: No active risk; Cons: Clutter repo—recommend deletion").
  - Automate where possible: Use `search_files` for patterns like error handling across groups.
- **Quality Assurance:** Each review includes grades, recommendations, and ties to ColdVox core (e.g., Vosk/STT impacts).

## Step 3: Generation and Iteration
- **Bulk Document Creation:** After reviewing a group, use `write_to_file` for the output MD. If multiple groups ready, sequence tool calls.
- **Validation:** Post-generation, use `attempt_completion` per group or overall batch.
- **Timeline Estimate:** 6 groups → ~3-4 operations (batch low-impact in one); total time savings: 70% vs. individual reviews (22 separate → 6 grouped).
- **Post-Review:** Aggregate all group MDs into a summary report in `docs/intensiveReview/summary.md` for overall grades and action items.

## Implementation Todo List
This process aligns with the current todo list. Proceed by switching modes to execute group reviews in priority order.

*Estimated Completion:* All reviews in 4-6 steps, maintaining B-level thoroughness.
