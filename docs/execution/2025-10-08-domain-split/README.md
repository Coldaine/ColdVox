**Branch Split:** `anchor/oct-06-2025` ‚Üí 9 domain-based PRs
**Execution Agent:** Agent-1 (Splitter) + Build Validator
**Status:** Phase 1-3 Complete, Phase 4-6 In Progress

---

## Overview

This directory contains the complete execution artifacts from splitting the monolithic refactor branch (`anchor/oct-06-2025`, 108 files, 56 commits) into 9 domain-based stacked PRs using Graphite.

**Strategy:** Domain-based split following crate boundaries for minimal conflicts and parallel review opportunities.

**PRs Created:** #123 ‚Üí #124 ‚Üí #125 ‚Üí #126 ‚Üí #127 ‚Üí #128 ‚Üí #129 ‚Üí #130 ‚Üí #131

## Execution Summary

### Phase 1: Split ‚úÖ
- **Duration:** ~2 hours
- **Method:** File-based routing (automated via script + manual commits)
- **Output:** 9 branches with standardized commits `[NN/09]`
- **Issues:** 1 branch had incorrect files (fixed via reset + re-checkout)

### Phase 2: Validation ‚úÖ
- **Duration:** ~5 minutes
- **Method:** Full-stack validation at tip (branch 09)
- **Result:** `cargo check --workspace` PASS, E2E test PASS
- **Fixes:** Added missing `config` dependency (propagated to all branches)

### Phase 3: PR Creation ‚úÖ
- **Duration:** ~3 minutes
- **Method:** `gh pr create` with generated descriptions
- **Output:** 9 PRs with complete metadata, correct stack dependencies
- **Compliance:** All PRs within size guardrails

### Phase 4: Reviews üü°
- **Status:** Awaiting reviewer assignment
- **Timeline:** 10-12 days estimated (with parallelization)
- **Parallel:** PRs #125 and #126 can be reviewed concurrently

### Phase 5: Merge ‚è≥
- **Status:** Pending review completion
- **Automation:** `merge-stack.sh` script ready
- **Critical:** PR #127 requires both #125 + #126 merged first

### Phase 6: Cleanup ‚è≥
- **Status:** Pending final merge
- **Tasks:** Verification, documentation updates, artifact archival

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total PRs | 9 |
| Total Files | 126 (with overlap) |
| LOC Added | ~9,074 |

## Critical Reminders

‚ö†Ô∏è **PR #127 Dependency:** Requires BOTH #125 (vad) AND #126 (stt) merged before it can merge

üîÑ **Restack After Each Merge:** Run `gt sync` after merging each PR to update downstream branches

‚ö° **Parallel Review:** PRs #125 and #126 can be reviewed simultaneously to save time

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Full-stack validation strategy (fast, accurate, no false positives)
2. Graphite restack (automatic propagation of fixes)
3. File-based routing (clean domain boundaries)
4. Force-with-lease push (safe remote updates)

### What Could Improve
1. Pre-commit dependency verification
2. Script automation for commit creation
3. Test output quieting (reduce ONNX logs)

### Recommendations for Future
1. Run `cargo check` on each branch before initial push
2. Add dependency closure verification to split script
3. Use `RUST_LOG=warn` for quieter validation runs

## Retrospective Items

**To Discuss:**
- Automation script effectiveness
- Review timeline accuracy
- Size guardrail appropriateness
- Parallel review adoption

**To Update:**
- `graphite_split_by_file.sh` - add commit creation
- CI workflow - add PR size warnings
- Split strategy docs - incorporate learnings
