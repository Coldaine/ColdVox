## Detailed Findings

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #100 ‚Äì CI & pre-commit improvements and plan
- **Status:** No evidence of CI or hook updates in this branch; `.github/workflows/` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` identical to `main`.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open and avoid closing in PR #121.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #63 ‚Äì Improve Qt6 detection logic in CI pipeline
- **Findings:** CI workflow yaml files and Qt detection scripts are unchanged; no improved detection or gating.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Issue #61 ‚Äì Document rationale for 500‚ÄØms VAD silence duration
- **Evidence:** Debugging playbook explicitly documents the 500‚ÄØms rationale (`docs/dev/debugging_playbook.md:73`), matching runtime commentary (`crates/app/src/runtime.rs:240`).
- **Recommendation:** Close issue #61 referencing PR #121.

### üî∂ PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Issue #40 ‚Äì Platform-Specific Text Injection Backend Testing
- **Progress:** Added `test_clipboard_restoration` covering clipboard save/restore when `wl_clipboard` is available (`crates/coldvox-text-injection/src/tests/test_integration.rs:117-172`).
- **Gaps:** When the feature is disabled (default case) the test only logs a skip; no alternative assertions exist. Focus detection regressions (#38) further weaken platform coverage.
- **Recommendation:** Update issue to reflect partial progress and outline remaining work (Wayland-enabled CI coverage, non-clipboard backends, regression fix).

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED (Regression): Issue #38 ‚Äì AT-SPI Application Identification Enhancement
- **Findings:** `FocusTracker::check_focus_status` now short-circuits to `FocusStatus::Unknown` for the AT-SPI path (`crates/coldvox-text-injection/src/focus.rs:51-72`), undoing prior improvements. Wayland/X11 fallbacks rely on `xdotool` without editable focus confirmation.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open and add regression note; follow-up fix required before merging.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #36 ‚Äì Fix memory allocations in audio capture callbacks
- **Findings:** Audio callback still uses thread-local vectors and per-frame conversions (`crates/coldvox-audio/src/capture.rs:409-520`), identical to `main`; no new allocation-free buffer strategy introduced.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #62 ‚Äì Add unit tests for GuiBridge state transitions
- **Findings:** `crates/coldvox-gui/src/bridge.rs` retains existing tests only; no new coverage added for state transitions or failure paths (`crates/coldvox-gui/src/bridge.rs:80-141`).
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #60 ‚Äì Connect GUI to real audio/STT backend services
- **Findings:** Implementation plan still marked draft with no backend wiring (`crates/coldvox-gui/docs/implementation-plan.md:1-25`); runtime code unchanged.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #59 ‚Äì Make GUI window dimensions configurable
- **Findings:** `config/default.toml` lacks any GUI dimension keys (`config/default.toml:1-61`); no QML updates.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #58 ‚Äì Implement backend integration for GuiBridge methods
- **Findings:** Bridge commands continue to mutate local state without delegating to backend services (`crates/coldvox-gui/src/bridge.rs:87-140`).
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #47 ‚Äì Implement async processing for non-blocking STT operations
- **Findings:** STT processor logic mirrors `main`; helper module (`crates/coldvox-stt/src/helpers.rs`) is unused and not exported. No new async pipeline or fan-out introduced.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #46 ‚Äì Harden STT model loading and validation
- **Findings:** Only formatting change in Vosk model extraction (`crates/coldvox-stt-vosk/src/model.rs`); no additional validation or checks.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #45 ‚Äì Optimize format conversions throughout audio pipeline
- **Findings:** Conversion path unchanged; still allocates via thread-local vectors per callback (`crates/coldvox-audio/src/capture.rs:454-520`).
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #44 ‚Äì Implement comprehensive STT performance metrics
- **Findings:** Only logging verbosity adjustments in plugin manager (`crates/app/src/stt/plugin_manager.rs:57-1100`); no new metrics recorded.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #42 ‚Äì Implement support for long utterance processing
- **Findings:** No buffering or long-utterance handling changes; STT processor identical to `main`.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #41 ‚Äì Whisper STT Backend Implementation
- **Findings:** No whisper backend activation or factory wiring; helper modules remain dormant.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #37 ‚Äì Implement comprehensive STT error recovery mechanisms
- **Findings:** Plugin manager failover logic unchanged aside from log level tweaks.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

### ‚ùå NOT RESOLVED: Issue #34 ‚Äì Integrate plugin system for extensible speech recognition engines
- **Findings:** Plugin configuration simply relocates to `config/plugins.json`; no new extensibility or runtime integration.
- **Recommendation:** Keep issue open.

## Regressions Observed

- **AT-SPI focus detection disabled:** `FocusTracker::check_focus_status` now returns `FocusStatus::Unknown` for AT-SPI, removing prior app identification support (`crates/coldvox-text-injection/src/focus.rs:51-72`).
- **Clipboard restoration test skips by default:** `test_clipboard_restoration` only verifies behaviour when `wl_clipboard` is enabled; default builds log `"Clipboard restoration test skipped"` (`crates/coldvox-text-injection/src/tests/test_integration.rs:170-173`).

## TODO / FIXME Audit

All tracked TODO/FIXME markers remain unaddressed:
- `crates/app/tests/settings_test.rs` still ignores env-override tests.
- `crates/coldvox-text-injection/src/manager.rs` retains TODO for proper app_id usage (`line 557`).
- `crates/coldvox-gui/src/bridge.rs` keeps TODO warnings (lines 96, 109, 120, 131).
- Additional TODOs persist across `examples/text_injection_probe.rs`, `crates/coldvox-text-injection/src/processor.rs`, `crates/coldvox-gui/src/main.rs`, and probe modules, matching the prior audit list.

## Testing Summary

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `cargo test -p coldvox-text-injection -- --list` | ‚úÖ Pass ‚Äì all 50 tests enumerated, clipboard restoration test skips without `wl_clipboard`. |
| Workspace build/tests | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not executed in this review; prior ALSA dependency failure is still expected in this environment. |

## Recommendations

1. **Do not close** issues #100, #63, #40 (pending), #38, and the remaining STT/audio tasks ‚Äì the branch does not deliver the required functionality and regresses AT-SPI focus handling.
2. **Address regression** in `FocusTracker` before merge; re-instate AT-SPI identification or provide an alternative solution.
3. **Expand tests** so clipboard restoration assertions run in default CI (consider feature-enabled job or mockable abstraction).
4. **Revisit documentation** and configuration examples to match the actual CLI/config behaviour introduced in this branch (see accompanying documentation updates).
