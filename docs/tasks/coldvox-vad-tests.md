## Test Cases Executed

### Energy Calculator Tests
1. `test_silence_returns_low_dbfs` - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests that silence (all zeros) returns a very low dBFS value
2. `test_full_scale_returns_zero_dbfs` - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests that full-scale signal returns 0 dBFS
3. `test_rms_calculation` - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests RMS calculation with known input values

### State Management Tests
4. `test_initial_state` - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests that VAD starts in Silence state with correct initial values
5. `test_speech_onset_debouncing` - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests speech onset debouncing logic with configurable debouncing
6. `test_speech_offset_debouncing` - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests speech offset debouncing logic with configurable debouncing
7. `test_speech_continuation` - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests that speech continues correctly during active periods

### Threshold Management Tests
8. `test_threshold_initialization` - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests that threshold calculator initializes with correct default values
9. `test_noise_floor_adaptation` - ✅ PASSED
   - Tests noise floor adaptation during silence periods
10. `test_no_update_during_speech` - ✅ PASSED
    - Tests that noise floor doesn't update during speech
11. `test_activation_deactivation` - ✅ PASSED
    - Tests VAD activation and deactivation with proper debouncing

## Notes
- All tests executed successfully without any failures or issues
- The tests validate core VAD functionality including energy calculation, state management, and threshold adaptation
- No special features or configurations were required to run these tests
