# ColdVox Project Status Report

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-26  
**Status:** Phase 4 complete; proceeding to Phase 5 (stress + polish)

---

## Executive Summary

ColdVox has successfully completed **Phase 0** (Foundation), **Phase 1** (Audio Capture with Recovery), and **Phase 2** (Lock-free Ring Buffer). All critical bugs that were preventing production use have been **RESOLVED**. The system is now ready to proceed to Phase 3 (VAD implementation).

## Phase Implementation Status

| Phase | Component | Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Phase 0** | Foundation & Safety Net | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** | Error handling, state management, graceful shutdown |
| **Phase 1** | Microphone Capture with Recovery | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** | Critical bugs fixed, production ready |
| **Phase 2** | Lock-free Ring Buffer | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** | Implemented using rtrb library |
| **Phase 3** | VAD with Fallback | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** | Silero V5 via ONNX; energy fallback ready |
| **Phase 4** | Smart Chunking | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** | Overlap + pre/post-roll; min-gap/min-chunk |
| **Phase 5+** | Stress Testing & Polish | üìã **NEXT** | Endurance, metrics export, UX polish |

## Critical Bug Resolution ‚úÖ

All 4 critical bugs identified in the remediation plan have been **FIXED**:

### 1. ‚úÖ Watchdog Timer Epoch Logic - FIXED
- **Issue**: Timer couldn't detect timeouts due to epoch mismatch
- **Solution**: Implemented shared epoch using `Arc<RwLock<Option<Instant>>>`
- **Result**: Recovery system now works correctly

### 2. ‚úÖ CPAL Sample Format Hardcoding - FIXED  
- **Issue**: Hardcoded i16 format failed on f32/u16 devices
- **Solution**: Dynamic format detection with multiple callback types
- **Result**: Works with all audio device formats (i16, f32, u16, u8, i8)

### 3. ‚úÖ Channel Negotiation Failure - FIXED
- **Issue**: Forced mono channels failed on stereo-only devices
- **Solution**: Use device native channels, downmix in callback
- **Result**: Compatible with both mono and stereo devices

### 4. ‚úÖ Missing Stop/Cleanup Methods - FIXED
- **Issue**: No clean shutdown violating Phase 0 requirements
- **Solution**: Implemented stop() methods for all components
- **Result**: Clean shutdown with proper resource cleanup

## Current Architecture

### Core Components Status
- ‚úÖ **Foundation Layer** - Complete and robust
- ‚úÖ **Audio System** - Production ready with recovery
- ‚úÖ **Ring Buffer** - Zero-allocation real-time safe (rtrb)
- üìã **VAD System** - Fork ready, needs integration
- üìã **Telemetry** - Partially implemented

### Threading Model (Working)
```
[Mic Thread] ‚Üí Ring Buffer ‚Üí [Processing Thread] ‚Üí [Output]
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì
[Watchdog]    [Error Handling]
```

### Audio Pipeline (Functional)
- **Input**: Any format/channels device supports
- **Processing**: Convert to 16kHz, i16, mono
- **Buffering**: Lock-free ring buffer (rtrb)
- **Recovery**: Automatic device reconnection with backoff

## Current metrics (as of 2025-08-26)

- Rust LOC (excl. target/Forks): 27,978
- Rust files: 58
- Markdown docs: 28
- Probes/demos: foundation_probe, mic_probe, vad_demo, vosk_test

## Development Environment

### Building & Testing
```bash
# Build system
cd crates/app && cargo build --release

# Test foundation systems  
cargo run --bin foundation_probe -- --duration 60

# Test audio capture with recovery
cargo run --bin mic_probe -- --duration 120

# Run test suite
cargo test
```

### Current Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for ring buffer
- ‚úÖ Integration test harnesses (foundation_probe, mic_probe)
- ‚úÖ Audio capture end-to-end testing
- üìã VAD tests (Phase 3)

## Risk Assessment: LOW ‚¨áÔ∏è

### Resolved Risks ‚úÖ
- ‚ùå ~~Core audio functionality broken~~ ‚Üí **FIXED**
- ‚ùå ~~Device compatibility issues~~ ‚Üí **FIXED**  
- ‚ùå ~~Recovery system non-functional~~ ‚Üí **FIXED**
- ‚ùå ~~Resource cleanup problems~~ ‚Üí **FIXED**

### Remaining Risks üü°
- Observability: Metrics/export not finalized; health monitor not yet active
- Coverage: Unit tests minimal; rely on probes
- Packaging: Runtime dependencies (ONNX) require validation in CI

### Phase 3 Risks üü°
- **VAD Model Loading**: ONNX runtime dependency management
- **Fallback Coordination**: Energy-based VAD as backup to model-based
- **Performance**: VAD processing within real-time constraints
