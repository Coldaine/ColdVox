# ColdVox Project Status

## Current Phase: Workspace Refactoring

The project is currently undergoing a major workspace refactoring to improve modularity and maintainability.

### Completed Work

#### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes âœ…
- Fixed audio capture watchdog stability
- Resolved frame processing issues
- Improved error handling and recovery

#### Phase 2: Ring Buffer Implementation âœ…
- Implemented lock-free SPSC ring buffer
- Improved backpressure handling
- Added comprehensive metrics and monitoring

#### Phase 3: Audio Pipeline Refactoring âœ…
- Centralized resampling in AudioChunker
- Separated capture from processing concerns
- Implemented proper stereo-to-mono conversion

#### Phase 4: Multi-Crate Workspace âœ…
- Split monolithic codebase into focused crates
- Established clear module boundaries
- Improved build times and testability

### Current Work

#### Phase 5: Text Injection Unification ðŸ”„
- Unifying TextInjector trait to async-first design
- Consolidating injection strategies
- Improving platform-specific backend selection

### Upcoming Work

#### Phase 6: STT Integration Enhancement
- Improve Vosk model management
- Add support for multiple STT backends
- Implement streaming transcription

#### Phase 7: GUI Development
- Design cross-platform GUI interface
- Implement configuration management
- Add real-time visualization
