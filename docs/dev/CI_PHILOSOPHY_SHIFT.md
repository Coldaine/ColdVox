# CI/CD Philosophy Shift: Fast Local > Slow Remote

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Issue**: Brittle CI blocks all feedback when one system tool missing  
**Solution**: Fast local pre-commit hooks + minimal CI

---

## The Problem with Over-Engineering CI

### What We Had
```yaml
# .github/actions/setup-coldvox/action.yml
- Check 18 system commands (xdotool, openbox, pulseaudio, ...)
- Check 4 pkg-config libraries (gtk, at-spi, ...)
- EXIT 1 if ANY missing
- Result: openbox not installed → ENTIRE CI fails → ZERO feedback
```

**Question:** Why crash everything if `openbox` is missing when 95% of tests don't need it?

**Answer:** There's no good reason. It's cargo-cult DevOps.

## New Philosophy

### Fast Local Checks (Pre-Commit Hook)

**What:** Run on every `git commit` automatically  
**Where:** Your dev machine  
**Time:** < 15 seconds (usually < 5s with cache)  
**Blocking:** No - warns but doesn't prevent commit

```bash
# .git-hooks/pre-commit-fast
cargo fmt --check        # Instant
cargo clippy             # Fast with cache
cargo check              # Fast with cache  
cargo build              # Fast with cache
cargo nextest run --lib  # Unit tests only
```

**Result:** Instant feedback, non-blocking, works on any machine

### Minimal CI (GitHub Actions)

**What:** Only test things that differ across machines  
**Where:** Self-hosted runner  
**Time:** ~2-5 minutes  
**Blocking:** Core jobs yes, optional jobs no

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-minimal.yml

# REQUIRED (must pass)
- check: Type check + build on stable + MSRV
- lint: fmt + clippy + docs
- test: Unit + integration tests

# OPTIONAL (can fail)
- text-injection: If X11 tools available
- vosk-e2e: If model available
```

**Result:** Core always runs, optional jobs don't block

## Comparison

### Old Way (Brittle)
```
Developer commits
  ↓
Push to GitHub
  ↓
CI starts
  ↓
Check for openbox ❌ NOT FOUND
  ↓
EXIT 1 - ENTIRE CI FAILS
  ↓
cargo check   (never ran)
cargo build   (never ran)
cargo test    (never ran)
  ↓
Developer: "WTF, I just changed a comment"
```

**Turnaround time:** 5+ minutes to find out CI setup is broken  
**Feedback quality:** None (didn't test your code)  
**Developer experience:** Frustrating

### New Way (Fast)
```
Developer commits
  ↓
Pre-commit hook runs (automatic)
  - cargo fmt     ✓ 0.2s
  - cargo clippy  ✓ 1.3s
  - cargo check   ✓ 0.8s
  - cargo build   ✓ 0.5s (cached)
  - cargo test    ✓ 2.1s
  ↓ (total: 5 seconds)
"✅ All checks passed!"
  ↓
Push to GitHub
  ↓
CI runs in parallel:
  - check (MSRV + stable)  ✓
  - lint                   ✓
  - test                   ✓
  - text-injection         ⚠️ (xdotool missing, skipped)
  - vosk-e2e              ✓
  ↓
Core jobs pass → PR mergeable
```

**Turnaround time:** 5 seconds (local) + 2-3 min (CI)  
**Feedback quality:** High (tested your code)  
**Developer experience:** Smooth

### Migration Path

#### Option A: Immediate Replacement (Recommended)

#### Option B: Gradual Transition
```bash
# Keep both CIs running

## Metrics

### Pre-Commit Hook Performance
```
Operation          Time      Cached Time
─────────────────────────────────────────
cargo fmt --check  0.2s      0.2s
cargo clippy       8.5s      1.3s
cargo check        6.2s      0.8s
cargo build        4.1s      0.5s
cargo test (lib)   3.8s      2.1s
─────────────────────────────────────────

Total (cached)     4.9s
```

**Typical experience:** 5-10 seconds per commit

### CI Pipeline Comparison
```

────────────────────────────────────────
Setup time          2-3 min   10s
Test time           5-7 min   2-3 min
Total time          7-10 min  2-4 min
Failure rate        ~30%      ~5%
False positives     High      Low
Feedback quality    None      High
```

## Anti-Patterns Avoided

### ❌ Fail Fast on Non-Critical Dependencies
```yaml
# DON'T DO THIS
- name: Check ALL the things
  run: |
    for cmd in xdotool openbox wmctrl xprop ...; do
      command -v $cmd || exit 1  # ← Blocks everything
    done
```

**Why bad:** One missing tool = zero feedback on your code

### ❌ Slow Pre-Commit Hooks
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS
cargo test --all-features --all-targets  # Takes 5 minutes
```

**Why bad:** Developers will `git commit --no-verify` and hook becomes useless

### ❌ Blocking Optional Tests
```yaml
# DON'T DO THIS
test_text_injection:
  runs-on: self-hosted
  steps:
    - run: cargo test -p coldvox-text-injection
      # ← Fails if xdotool missing, blocks merge
```

**Why bad:** Irrelevant failures block unrelated changes

---

## Best Practices Followed

### ✅ Fast Non-Blocking Local Checks
```bash
# DO THIS
# Hook runs in < 5s, warns but doesn't block
cargo fmt --check        # Instant
cargo clippy --lib       # Fast (skip integration tests)
cargo nextest run --lib  # Unit tests only
```

**Why good:** High compliance, fast iteration, happy developers

### ✅ Layered Testing Strategy
```
Layer 1: Pre-commit (local, < 5s)
  → fmt, clippy, check, build, unit tests

Layer 2: CI Core (required, ~2 min)
  → MSRV check, full lint, integration tests

Layer 3: CI Optional (continue-on-error, ~5 min)
  → Text injection, E2E, platform-specific
```

**Why good:** Each layer provides value independently

### ✅ Self-Documenting Requirements
```yaml
# DO THIS
- name: Check if tools available
  id: check_tools
  run: |
    has_tools=true
    for tool in xdotool Xvfb openbox; do
      if ! command -v $tool; then
        echo "Missing: $tool"  # ← Documents what's needed
        has_tools=false
      fi
    done

- name: Run tests
  if: steps.check_tools.outputs.available == 'true'  # ← Explicit gate
```

**Why good:** Clear what's required, graceful degradation

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Local > Remote
Pre-commit hooks provide 10x better feedback than CI for most checks.

### 2. Non-Blocking > Blocking
Warnings work better than errors for optional checks.

### 3. Fast > Comprehensive
A 5-second check you run on every commit beats a 5-minute check you skip.

### 4. Layered > Monolithic
Multiple stages (local, CI core, CI optional) better than all-or-nothing.

### 5. Self-Documenting > Implicit
Explicit tool checks better than mysterious CI failures.

## Questions Answered

**Q: Why not just fix the runner provisioning?**  
A: That fixes the symptom, not the problem. The problem is brittleness.

**Q: Won't this skip important tests?**  
A: No - core tests always run. Optional tests run when tools available.

**Q: What if text injection breaks?**  
A: CI will warn you. If it's critical, provision the runner. If not, ignore.

**Q: How do we ensure runner has correct tools?**  
A: Document in `docs/dev/RUNNER_SETUP.md`, check in health script.

**Q: Can we still run full tests locally?**  
A: Yes! `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features`

**Q: What about release testing?**  
A: Add separate release workflow that runs everything (not on every PR).
