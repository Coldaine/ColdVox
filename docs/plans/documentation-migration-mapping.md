# Documentation Migration Mapping

This plan catalogs existing Markdown files and maps each one to the canonical target location (or disposition) required by the Master Documentation Playbook v1.0.0. The mapping will guide the relocation work in Phase 3 and ensures no markdown remains outside `/docs` except approved exceptions.

## Status Update

Phase 1 and the majority of Phase 2–3 migrations have been executed. Remaining items focus on metadata normalization and README governance updates.

## Legend

- **Target** — Canonical destination path under `/docs`.
- **Action** — `move`, `delete`, `archive`, or `retain-exception`.
- **Notes** — Additional steps (e.g., add retention banner, normalize filename, requires new stub).
