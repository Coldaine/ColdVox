# Achieving A+ Grade: Refactor Split Strategy Enhancements

**Context:** The domain-based refactor split plan was graded **A-**. This document explains what would elevate it to **A+** and provides actionable suggestions.

**Date:** 2024-10-07
**Status:** Recommendations for Implementation

---

## What's Missing from A-? (The 0.5 Point Deduction)

The original analysis stated:

> **Grade: A-** (deducted 0.5 for P0 bug delay, which is easily fixed with PR #0)

**Root Cause:** In the original Plan 2, the critical P0 clipboard paste bug fix was delayed until PR #6 (text-injection), which would land mid-to-late in the stack. This creates production risk where an urgent bug fix must wait for 5 other PRs to merge first.

---

## The Fix: Add PR #0 (Hotfix-First Strategy)

### What Changed

**Before (A- Grade):**
```
01-config-settings
02-audio-capture
03-vad
04-stt
05-app-runtime-wav
06-text-injection  ‚Üê P0 bug fix buried here
07-testing
08-logging-observability
09-docs-changelog
```

**After (A+ Grade):**
```
00-hotfix-clipboard-p0  ‚Üê NEW: P0 bug fix lands first
01-config-settings
02-audio-capture
03-vad
04-stt
05-app-runtime-wav
06-text-injection       ‚Üê Remaining text-injection changes
07-testing
08-logging-observability
09-docs-changelog
```

### Why This Achieves A+

1. **Zero Delay for Critical Bugs** - P0 fix merges immediately (hours, not days)
2. **Production Risk Mitigation** - Urgent fixes don't wait for large refactors
3. **Parallel Unblocking** - Team can fix production while refactor proceeds
4. **Precedent for Future** - Establishes hotfix-first pattern for similar situations
5. **Complete Solution** - Addresses the ONLY weakness of the original plan

## Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Extract During Split (Recommended)

When running `gt split --by-hunk`, consciously extract the P0 bug fix:

```bash
# During interactive split:
# - Identify the ~10 lines that fix clipboard paste P0 bug
# - Assign them to a new branch: 00-hotfix-clipboard-p0
# - Assign remaining text-injection changes to 06-text-injection

# After split:
gt checkout 00-hotfix-clipboard-p0
gt move --onto main  # Make it base of stack
```

**Pro:** Clean separation from the start  
**Con:** Requires careful hunk identification during split

### Option 2: Cherry-Pick After Split

Split normally, then extract the hotfix:

```bash
# After running gt split --by-hunk:
gt checkout 06-text-injection

# Create new branch for hotfix
gt create --insert 00-hotfix-clipboard-p0

# Cherry-pick only the P0 fix lines
git cherry-pick <commit-with-p0-fix> -- path/to/clipboard_paste_injector.rs

# Edit to keep only P0 fix (~10 lines)
# Commit

# Move to base of stack
gt checkout 00-hotfix-clipboard-p0
gt move --onto main

# Remove P0 fix from PR #6
gt checkout 06-text-injection
git revert <commit-with-p0-fix>
# Or manually remove the duplicate lines
```

**Pro:** Easier to identify what to extract after seeing full changes  
**Con:** Extra steps; more complex Graphite operations

### Option 3: Manual Creation (Fallback)

If Graphite becomes too complex, create PR #0 manually:

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b 00-hotfix-clipboard-p0

# Cherry-pick or manually apply only P0 fix
# Commit and push

# Then continue with normal split for other PRs
```

**Pro:** Simplest for newcomers to Graphite  
**Con:** Doesn't use Graphite stack features; manual dependency management

---

## Additional A+ Enhancements (Optional)

While PR #0 is sufficient for A+, here are suggestions to make the plan **exceptional**:

### 1. PR Sizing Guidelines

Add explicit size targets to avoid "PR too large" reviews:

| PR | Target Lines | Max Lines | If Exceeds Max |
|----|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| #00 | ~10 | 50 | Extract to separate hotfix |
| #01 | 200-400 | 800 | Split into config-core + config-integration |
| #02 | 300-500 | 1000 | Split by audio subsystem |
| #03 | 150-300 | 600 | OK (VAD is small domain) |
| #04 | 150-300 | 600 | OK (STT is small domain) |
| #05 | 400-600 | 1200 | Split into runtime + wav-loader |
| #06 | 300-500 | 1000 | OK (already split from P0) |
| #07 | 200-400 | 800 | OK (test infra) |
| #08 | 100-200 | 400 | OK (logging is scattered) |
| #09 | 200-400 | 800 | OK (docs only) |

**Action:** Monitor PR sizes during split; re-split if exceeding max.

### 2. Automated Validation Scripts

Add pre-merge validation for each PR:

```bash
# .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml
name: PR Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check PR size
        run: |
          LINES_CHANGED=$(git diff --shortstat origin/main | awk '{print $4+$6}')
          if [ "$LINES_CHANGED" -gt 1000 ]; then
            echo "::warning::PR has $LINES_CHANGED lines. Consider splitting."
          fi
      
      - name: Check crate isolation
        run: |
          # Verify PR only modifies 1-2 crates
          CRATES_MODIFIED=$(git diff --name-only origin/main | grep "^crates/" | cut -d/ -f2 | sort -u | wc -l)
          if [ "$CRATES_MODIFIED" -gt 2 ]; then
            echo "::error::PR modifies $CRATES_MODIFIED crates. Should be 1-2 max."
            exit 1
          fi
```

**Action:** Add to repository after stack execution to prevent future violations.

### 3. Dependency Documentation Template

Add to each PR description:

```markdown
## Stack Position

- **Position:** #03 of 10
- **Depends On:** PR #02 (audio-capture)
- **Blocks:** PR #05 (app-runtime-wav)
- **Parallel With:** PR #04 (stt) ‚úÖ

## Merge Strategy

- [ ] Wait for PR #02 to merge
- [ ] Rebase after PR #02 merge: `gt sync`
- [ ] Merge this PR
- [ ] Notify PR #05 owner to rebase

## Rollback Plan

If this PR causes issues:
1. Revert commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`
2. Only affects: crates/coldvox-vad/**
3. Downstream impact: PR #05 may need adjustment
```

**Action:** Add to PR templates for stacked PRs.

### 4. Integration Testing Matrix

Document which combinations have been tested:

| Config | Audio | VAD | STT | Runtime | Injection | Result |
|--------|-------|-----|-----|---------|-----------|--------|
| ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Full stack validated |
| ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Works without STT |
| ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Works with VAD disabled |

**Action:** Add to PR #09 (final PR) to document tested configurations.

### 5. Merge Conflict Prevention Checklist

Before merging each PR, verify:

- [ ] PR modifies only 1-2 crates (no cross-cutting changes)
- [ ] No changes to files already modified in pending PRs
- [ ] All dependencies merged (use `gt log` to verify)
- [ ] CI passes (all tests green)
- [ ] Manual smoke test passed for PR's domain
- [ ] Downstream PRs notified if interface changes made

**Action:** Add to merge checklist for each PR.

- [ ] **<1000** lines per PR (none exceed max)
- [ ] **1-2** crates modified per PR (clean isolation)
- [ ] **2-3** merge conflicts total (vs 5-7 predicted for alternatives)
- [ ] **0-1** CI failures (vs 3-4 for alternatives)

### Qualitative
- [ ] **All** reviewers understand stack structure
- [ ] **All** PRs have clear dependency documentation
- [ ] **All** merge order mistakes prevented
- [ ] **Team** reports confidence in process
- [ ] **Stakeholders** satisfied with delivery speed (1-2 weeks)

## Conclusion

**The path from A- to A+ is simple:** Add PR #0 to extract the P0 clipboard bug fix.

**Going beyond A+ to "exceptional":** Implement the optional enhancements for sizing, validation, documentation, and automation.

**ROI:** 
- A+ grade: 1 hour of work (extracting PR #0)
- A++ process: 4-8 hours of work (automation + documentation)
- Long-term benefit: 50% reduction in refactor friction for future work
