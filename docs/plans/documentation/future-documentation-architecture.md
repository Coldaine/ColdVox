# Future Documentation Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the future state of ColdVox documentation architecture, based on the comprehensive restructure proposal in `docs/proposal_documentation_restructure.md`. The goal is to transform our current scattered documentation into a well-organized, maintainable, and discoverable knowledge base.

## Current State Assessment

**Problems with Current Documentation:**
- Scattered across 50+ files in 10+ subdirectories
- Inconsistent organization and naming
- Overlapping content between similar documents
- Poor discoverability for both humans and AI agents
- No clear standards or governance
- Missing revision tracking and maintenance processes

**Assets to Preserve:**
- Comprehensive technical content (e.g., `TextInjectionArchitecture.md`)
- Domain-specific knowledge in crate documentation
- Historical research and planning documents
- Established development workflows

## Future State Vision

### Core Principles

1. **Domain-Oriented Organization** - Documentation mirrors crate structure and functional domains
2. **Centralized Governance** - Standards, playbooks, and processes defined in `/docs`
3. **Automated Enforcement** - CI/CD validation of documentation standards
4. **Agent-Optimized** - Clear index and structure for AI assistants
5. **Maintainable** - Revision tracking, changelog policies, and clear ownership

### Target File Structure

### Key Components

#### 1. Architecture Documentation (`docs/architecture.md`)
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for system design and vision
- **Content**: High-level overview, component relationships, future roadmap
- **Audience**: New contributors, stakeholders, architects
- **Maintenance**: Updated with major architectural changes

#### 2. Standards Documentation (`docs/standards.md`)
- **Purpose**: Define documentation policies and quality standards
- **Content**: Revision tracking requirements, changelog policies, file placement rules
- **Audience**: All contributors
- **Enforcement**: CI validation

#### 3. Agent Guidelines (`docs/agents.md`)
- **Purpose**: Optimize documentation for AI assistants
- **Content**: Documentation index, search patterns, contribution guidelines
- **Audience**: AI agents (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- **Maintenance**: Updated when structure changes

#### 4. Domain Documentation (`docs/domains/`)
- **Purpose**: Technical deep-dive for each functional area
- **Content**: API references, implementation details, troubleshooting
- **Audience**: Developers working in specific domains
- **Structure**: Mirror crate organization for easy navigation

#### 5. Playbooks (`docs/playbooks/`)
- **Purpose**: Standardized processes and procedures
- **Content**: How-to guides, workflows, best practices
- **Audience**: Contributors following established processes
- **Types**: Organizational (reusable) vs project-specific

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Branch)
- ✅ Create target directory structure
- ✅ Migrate core architectural content
- ✅ Establish documentation standards
- ⏳ Create agent index and guidelines

### Phase 2: Migration
- Move crate-specific docs to domain folders
- Consolidate overlapping content
- Update all cross-references
- Archive obsolete documents

### Phase 3: Governance
- Implement CI enforcement
- Establish revision tracking and file watcher
- Create maintenance playbooks
- Train contributors on new structure

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Add advanced features (auto-generated diagrams, cross-linking)
- Implement search and discovery tools
- Continuous improvement based on usage feedback

## Documentation Standards

### File Headers
All documentation files must include:
```markdown
---
doc_type: [architecture|standard|playbook|reference|research]
subsystem: [domain name or "general"]
version: [semantic version]
status: [draft|review|approved|deprecated]
owners: [team or individual]
last_reviewed: [YYYY-MM-DD]
---
```

### Revision Tracking
- All changes logged to `docs/revision_log.csv`
- **File Watcher**: Automated monitoring of `**/*.md` files to log create/update/move/delete events
- CI validates header presence on modified files
- Changelog updates required for user-facing changes

### Placement Rules
- **Primary Rule**: All `.md` files belong in `/docs`
- **Exceptions**: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.vscode/settings.json`, `.gitignore`
- **Rationale**: Centralized discovery and maintenance

## Benefits

### For Humans
- **Discoverability**: Clear structure and comprehensive index
- **Maintainability**: Standards and processes reduce technical debt
- **Quality**: Peer review and CI enforcement improve consistency
- **Onboarding**: New contributors can quickly understand the system

### For AI Agents
- **Predictable Structure**: Domain-based organization matches code structure
- **Comprehensive Index**: `docs/agents.md` provides navigation guidance
- **Standardized Format**: Consistent headers and metadata enable better parsing
- **Process Guidance**: Playbooks provide context for contribution workflows

### For the Project
- **Reduced Duplication**: Consolidated overlapping content
- **Better Governance**: Clear ownership and maintenance processes
- **Future-Proof**: Scalable structure accommodates growth
- **Professional Polish**: Well-organized docs improve project credibility

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: 90% of contributors using new structure within 3 months
- **Maintenance Burden**: <30 minutes/week for documentation maintenance
- **Discovery Time**: New contributors find needed info within 5 minutes
- **CI Compliance**: 100% of PRs pass documentation standards checks
- **Cross-References**: Zero broken links in documentation

## Migration Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Complete directory structure and standards
- **Week 3-4**: Migrate core architectural content
- **Week 5-6**: Move domain-specific documentation
- **Week 7-8**: Implement CI enforcement and training
- **Ongoing**: Continuous improvement and maintenance

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Resistance to Change**: Provide comprehensive training and migration support
- **Initial Overhead**: Start with high-value migrations, defer low-priority content
- **Broken Links**: Implement redirect system during transition
- **Maintenance Burden**: Automate as much as possible through CI

## Conclusion

This documentation architecture represents a significant improvement over the current scattered approach. By implementing domain-oriented organization, clear standards, and automated governance, we create a knowledge base that scales with the project while remaining accessible to both human and AI contributors.

The foundation work in this branch (`docs/migrate-kiro-docs`) establishes the structure and migrates initial content. Future phases will complete the migration and implement governance processes.
