# Branch status and work in progress overview (2025-11-06 04:16Z)

_**User (2025-11-06 04:32Z)**_

#codebase  This, can you just tell me what it looks like we're in the middle of? What branch we're on and what we were doing? I like, it doesn't look clean and so I'm kind of lost.

**Checking git status and branch****Addressing Git safe.directory setting****Checking git status again****Checking recent commits on branch****Reading architecture proposal doc****Reviewing branch state and changes****Summarizing current repo status and changes**

- On branch `retro-plan-vs-actual`; last commit `df86c08` (“retro: add docs_metadata CSV snapshot (92 files)”) is at HEAD; `origin/main` is still at `7bb7f26`.
- Untracked file `golden-master-test-architecture-proposal.md` (~700 lines) describes a full Golden Master testing plan, detailing seven pipeline anchor points, artifact formats, CLI workflows, and nondeterminism mitigation.
- I marked `` as a safe Git directory so status commands work under your user account.

**Likely Work In Progress**
- Drafting the Golden Master test architecture document for the retro initiative.

**Next Steps**
2. Stage and commit the new Golden Master proposal once you’re happy with the draft.
