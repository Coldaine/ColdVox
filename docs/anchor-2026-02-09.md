# Documentation Anchor (2026-02-09)

This document defines what the repository is anchoring on as of 2026-02-09.
It is a working decision record for pruning and rewriting docs.

## Anchor Rule

- `docs/northstar.md` is the primary anchor for product and system direction.
- During documentation triage, any document content that does not support the North Star should be:
  - rewritten to align,
  - moved to `docs/archive/`, or
  - deleted if low-value and superseded.
- Aspirational and research documents are valid, but they must be explicit about status and intent.

## Scope Lock

- Active documentation should optimize for current goals rather than preserving every historical branch of thought.
- Historical docs may be retained only when they provide reusable design rationale, test rationale, or migration context.
- Orphan plans with no path to execution should be archived or removed.

## 2026-02-09 Initial Anchor Inputs

The initial North Star inputs currently captured are:

- CUDA-first high-end STT performance on RTX 5090-class hardware.
- Reliable fallback STT path for non-CUDA machines (Moonshine baseline).
- Transparent GUI overlay that displays recognized words while speaking.
- Live word display in both PTT and speech-detection modes.
- Streaming partial transcription (no end-of-utterance wait for visible text).

## Resolved Direction (2026-02-09)

- Reliability is the near-term top priority.
- End-to-end success criteria: speak into microphone and get correct injection output consistently.
- STT support position: Moonshine now, Parakeet later.
- Fallback policy: Moonshine is mandatory on non-CUDA machines.
- Live UX policy: partial tokens should display immediately and may update as decoding stabilizes.
- Overlay policy: visible while actively capturing.
- Requirement style: practical reliability first; avoid premature numeric acceptance thresholds.
- CUDA interpretation: prioritize best CUDA-capable model path selection and integration.
- Injection error policy: retry once, then surface overlay notification.
- Advanced confirmation (for example OCR-based injection verification): roadmap item, not immediate requirement.
- CI docs source of truth: `docs/dev/CI/architecture.md`.
- Retention policy: archive by default, delete only when low-value and superseded.

## Review Workflow

- Review docs in fixed batches (for example 10 docs at a time).
- For each doc: classify as keep, keep+edit, archive, or delete.
- Resolve requirement ambiguities first, then execute doc edits.
