## Summary
Implementation of lock-free ring buffer communication using rtrb library.

## Description
This implementation provides lock-free communication between the audio capture thread and processing tasks using the rtrb SPSC ring buffer.

## Key Components
- SPSC ring buffer creation and management
- Producer and consumer interfaces
- Error handling for buffer conditions
- Performance optimization

## Code Structure
```rust
// Ring buffer wrapper implementation
pub struct AudioRingBuffer {
    producer: Producer<i16>,
    consumer: Consumer<i16>,
}

impl AudioRingBuffer {
    pub fn new(capacity: usize) -> Self {
        let (producer, consumer) = rtrb::RingBuffer::new(capacity);
        Self { producer, consumer }
    }
    
    pub fn split(self) -> (AudioBufferProducer, AudioBufferConsumer) {
        let producer = AudioBufferProducer { inner: self.producer };
        let consumer = AudioBufferConsumer { inner: self.consumer };
        (producer, consumer)
    }
}

pub struct AudioBufferProducer {
    inner: Producer<i16>,
}

impl AudioBufferProducer {
    pub fn push_slice(&mut self, data: &[i16]) -> Result<usize, PushError> {
        self.inner.push_slice(data)
    }
}
```

## Dependencies
- rtrb = "0.2"
- thiserror = "1.0"
