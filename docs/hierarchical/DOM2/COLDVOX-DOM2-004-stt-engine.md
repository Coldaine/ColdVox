## Description
This domain implements the speech-to-text transcription engine with support for multiple backends, including Vosk for offline operation via FFI and potentially Whisper for cloud-based transcription.

## Key Components
- STT engine abstraction (trait)
- Vosk implementation (primary)
- Transcription event generation (Partial, Final, Error)
- Model management and loading
- Vosk library integration via FFI
- Model loading and management
- Transcription processing
- Event generation (Partial, Final, Error)

## Requirements
- Support for multiple STT engines
- Offline operation capability
- Real-time partial results
- Configurable quality settings
- Offline transcription capability
- Real-time partial results
- Support for multiple languages
- Proper error handling
