## Summary
Implement comprehensive telemetry and metrics collection for monitoring the performance, reliability, and quality of the ColdVox voice AI pipeline.

## Description
This domain provides telemetry infrastructure for collecting, processing, and exporting metrics related to audio processing performance, transcription quality, injection success rates, and system health. The telemetry system enables data-driven optimization and operational monitoring.

## Key Components
- **PipelineMetrics**: Core metrics collection for audio pipeline performance
- **FpsTracker**: Frame rate tracking for real-time performance monitoring
- **Latency Metrics**: End-to-end and component-level latency tracking
- **Quality Metrics**: Transcription accuracy and injection success rate tracking
- **Error Metrics**: Error rate and failure mode tracking
- **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, and I/O usage monitoring

## Requirements
- Low overhead metrics collection (< 1% CPU usage)
- Real-time metric updates with minimal latency
- Comprehensive coverage of pipeline components
- Integration with tracing infrastructure
- Configurable metric export formats
- Persistent storage for historical analysis
- Alerting capabilities for anomaly detection

## Success Metrics
- Metrics collection overhead: < 1% CPU usage
- Metric update latency: < 1ms
- Coverage: 100% of critical pipeline components
- Data retention: 30 days of historical metrics
- Alert response time: < 5 seconds for critical issues
- Export reliability: > 99.9% successful exports
