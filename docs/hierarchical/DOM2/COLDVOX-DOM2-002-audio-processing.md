## Summary
Process captured audio through resampling, chunking, and buffering for downstream consumption.

## Description
This domain handles the processing of captured audio data, including resampling to the required sample rate, chunking into fixed-size frames, and buffering for communication between the real-time capture thread and the async processing tasks. Implemented with lock-free ring buffer communication using rtrb for thread-safe data transfer.

## Key Components
- Audio resampling (Rubato library)
- Audio chunking (fixed-size frames)
- Ring buffer communication (rtrb library)
- Frame reader for sample normalization
- SPSC (Single Producer, Single Consumer) ring buffer
- Atomic counters for lock-free operation
- Buffer management and error handling
- Performance monitoring

## Requirements
- Consistent sample rate conversion
- Fixed-size frame output (512 samples)
- Lock-free communication between threads
- Minimal processing latency
- Lock-free operation to avoid priority inversion
- Low latency communication
- Proper error handling for buffer full/empty conditions
- Minimal overhead
