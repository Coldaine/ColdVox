## Summary
Manage audio device discovery, capture, and configuration across multiple platforms.

## Description
This domain handles the discovery and management of audio input devices, as well as the real-time capture of audio data from these devices using platform-appropriate APIs. Implemented via CPAL integration for cross-platform audio capture.

## Key Components
- Device discovery and enumeration
- Real-time audio capture thread
- Platform-specific audio APIs (ALSA, WASAPI, CoreAudio)
- Device configuration and monitoring
- CPAL host initialization
- Device enumeration and selection
- Stream configuration and error handling
- Platform-specific optimizations

## Requirements
- Support for multiple audio APIs
- Automatic device detection and reconfiguration
- Low-latency capture (target < 50ms)
- Graceful handling of device disconnections
- Support for major desktop platforms
- Consistent API across platforms
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Device hotplug support
