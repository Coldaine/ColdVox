## Summary
Provide core infrastructure components including application state management, graceful shutdown handling, system health monitoring, and unified error handling for the ColdVox voice AI pipeline.

## Description
This domain encompasses the foundational infrastructure that supports all other ColdVox components, providing essential services such as state management, shutdown coordination, health monitoring, and error handling. These components ensure the robustness and reliability of the entire system.

## Key Components
- **AppState & StateManager**: Centralized application state with validated transitions
- **ShutdownHandler**: Graceful shutdown coordination with Ctrl+C handler and panic hook
- **HealthMonitor**: System health monitoring and failure detection
- **Error Types**: Unified error handling with domain-specific error types
- **Configuration**: Base configuration structures and validation

## Requirements
- Centralized state management with thread-safe access
- Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C, panic, or explicit request
- Health monitoring with automatic failure detection
- Comprehensive error handling with context preservation
- Configuration validation and type safety
- Minimal performance overhead
- Integration with tracing/logging infrastructure

## Success Metrics
- State transitions: 100% validated with no invalid states
- Shutdown time: < 1 second for normal termination
- Health check interval: < 100ms overhead
- Error propagation: Complete context preservation
- Panic recovery: 100% handled without data loss
