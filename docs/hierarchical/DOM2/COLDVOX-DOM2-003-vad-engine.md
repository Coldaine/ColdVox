## Summary
Implement and integrate voice activity detection algorithms to identify speech segments.

## Description
This domain provides the core VAD engine implementation, supporting multiple algorithms with a pluggable architecture. The primary implementation uses the Silero VAD model via ONNX inference.

## Key Components
- VAD engine abstraction (trait)
- Silero VAD implementation (primary)
- Configuration management
- Event generation (SpeechStart, SpeechEnd)
- Silero model loading and initialization
- ONNX inference execution
- Threshold configuration and tuning
- Event generation and debouncing

## Requirements
- Support for multiple VAD algorithms
- Configurable sensitivity thresholds
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Low latency event generation
- High accuracy VAD performance
- Low latency inference
- Configurable sensitivity thresholds
- Proper event debouncing
