## Summary
Implement cross-platform text injection with adaptive backend strategies.

## Description
This domain provides the text injection system with support for multiple backends and an adaptive strategy manager that selects the most appropriate method based on the current environment and application, including strategy manager with backend selection logic, success rate tracking, fallback chain, and application-specific caching.

## Key Components
- Backend abstraction (trait)
- Multiple injection backends (AT-SPI, clipboard, ydotool, etc.)
- Strategy manager for adaptive selection
- Session and window management
- Success rate tracking and learning
- Fallback chain management
- Application-specific strategy caching

## Requirements
- Support for major desktop environments
- Multiple injection backends
- Adaptive strategy selection
- High success rate across applications
- High text injection success rate
- Adaptive learning from past attempts
- Proper fallback handling
- Minimal performance overhead
