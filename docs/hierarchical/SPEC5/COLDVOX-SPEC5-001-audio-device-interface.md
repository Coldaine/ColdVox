## Summary
Define the interface for audio device management and capture.

## Description
This specification defines the interface for audio device management, including device enumeration, selection, and real-time capture operations.

## Interface
```rust
pub trait DeviceManager {
    fn enumerate_devices() -> Result<Vec<DeviceInfo>, AudioError>;
    fn select_device(device_id: &str) -> Result<DeviceHandle, AudioError>;
    fn start_capture(device: DeviceHandle) -> Result<AudioCaptureThread, AudioError>;
}

pub struct DeviceInfo {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub sample_rate: u32,
    pub channels: u16,
}

pub struct DeviceHandle {
    pub id: String,
    pub stream: Stream,
}
```

## Requirements
- Support for device enumeration
- Device selection by ID
- Real-time capture stream management
- Proper error handling
