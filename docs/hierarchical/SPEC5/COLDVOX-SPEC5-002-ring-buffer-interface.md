## Summary
Define the interface for lock-free ring buffer communication.

## Description
This specification defines the interface for the lock-free ring buffer used for communication between the audio capture thread and processing tasks.

## Interface
```rust
pub struct AudioRingBuffer {
    producer: Producer<i16>,
    consumer: Consumer<i16>,
}

impl AudioRingBuffer {
    pub fn new(capacity: usize) -> Self;
    pub fn split(self) -> (AudioBufferProducer, AudioBufferConsumer);
    pub fn capacity(&self) -> usize;
}

pub struct AudioBufferProducer {
    inner: Producer<i16>,
}

impl AudioBufferProducer {
    pub fn push_slice(&mut self, data: &[i16]) -> Result<usize, PushError>;
}

pub struct AudioBufferConsumer {
    inner: Consumer<i16>,
}

impl AudioBufferConsumer {
    pub fn pop_slice(&mut self, data: &mut [i16]) -> Result<usize, PopError>;
}
```

## Requirements
- Lock-free operation
- SPSC (Single Producer, Single Consumer) design
- Efficient data transfer
- Proper error handling
