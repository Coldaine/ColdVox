## Summary
Implement global hotkey support for ColdVox with platform-specific backend integration, enabling users to control the application without switching focus.

## Description
This system provides global hotkey functionality using platform-specific APIs, with KDE KGlobalAccel integration on Linux and equivalent solutions on other platforms. The hotkey system allows users to start/stop recording, toggle modes, and trigger other actions from anywhere on their system.

## Key Components
- **KGlobalAccel Integration**: KDE global hotkey support on Linux
- **Platform Abstraction**: Cross-platform hotkey registration and handling
- **Hotkey Manager**: Centralized hotkey registration and dispatch
- **Configuration**: User-configurable hotkey bindings
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling of hotkey conflicts with other applications

## Requirements
- Cross-platform hotkey support
- KDE KGlobalAccel integration on Linux
- User-configurable hotkey bindings
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Low system resource usage
- Reliable hotkey registration and unregistration
- Integration with application state management

## Success Metrics
- Hotkey registration success rate: > 99%
- Hotkey response time: < 50ms
- Cross-platform compatibility: 100% feature parity
- Conflict resolution: Automatic handling of 95%+ conflicts
- Resource usage: < 1MB memory overhead
- User configuration flexibility: 20+ configurable actions
