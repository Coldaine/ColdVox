## Summary
Implement a robust, low-latency audio capture and processing pipeline with automatic recovery mechanisms to ensure continuous operation even in the face of hardware issues or system interruptions.

## Description
This pillar encompasses all aspects of real-time audio processing, from device discovery and capture through resampling and chunking to prepare audio data for downstream voice activity detection and speech-to-text processing. The architecture employs a hybrid threading model to isolate real-time requirements from the async runtime.

## Key Requirements
- Support for multiple audio device types and platforms (ALSA/WASAPI/CoreAudio via CPAL)
- Low-latency audio capture (target < 50ms from microphone to processing)
- Automatic recovery from device disconnections or stream errors
- Resampling and chunking for consistent downstream processing (16kHz, 512-sample frames)
- Device hotplug support with automatic reconfiguration
- Watchdog monitoring for pipeline health with automatic restart capability

## Success Metrics
- Audio capture latency: < 50ms
- Automatic recovery success rate: > 99%
- Device compatibility across major platforms: 100%
- Stream restart time after error: < 2 seconds

## Technical Approach
The audio processing pipeline follows a layered approach:
1. **Device Management**: Enumerate and select appropriate input devices
2. **Capture Thread**: Dedicated OS thread owns CPAL stream to avoid preemption
3. **Ring Buffer Communication**: Lock-free SPSC ring buffer (rtrb) for inter-thread communication
4. **Resampling & Chunking**: Convert to target sample rate and frame size
5. **Watchdog Monitoring**: Detect and recover from stream issues automatically

## Dependencies
- CPAL library for cross-platform audio I/O
- rtrb crate for lock-free ring buffer implementation
- Rubato crate for high-quality resampling
- Platform-specific audio APIs (ALSA, WASAPI, CoreAudio)
