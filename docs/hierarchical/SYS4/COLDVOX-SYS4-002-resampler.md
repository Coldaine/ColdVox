## Summary
Implement audio resampling to convert captured audio to the required sample rate.

## Description
This system implements audio resampling using the Rubato library to convert captured audio to the required 16kHz sample rate for downstream processing.

## Key Components
- Sample rate conversion
- Quality configuration (Fast/Balanced/Quality)
- Buffer management
- Error handling

## Requirements
- Accurate sample rate conversion
- Configurable quality settings
- Minimal latency
- Proper error handling
