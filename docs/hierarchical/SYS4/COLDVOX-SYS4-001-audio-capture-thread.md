## Summary
Implement a dedicated real-time thread for audio capture to avoid preemption issues.

## Description
This system implements a dedicated OS thread for audio capture to isolate real-time requirements from the async runtime and prevent blocking or priority inversion issues.

## Key Components
- Dedicated thread spawning and management
- CPAL stream ownership
- Error handling and recovery
- Communication with async tasks

## Requirements
- Isolated real-time operation
- Proper thread lifecycle management
- Automatic recovery from errors
- Efficient communication with processing tasks
