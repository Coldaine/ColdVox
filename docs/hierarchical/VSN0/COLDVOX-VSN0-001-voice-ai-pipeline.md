## Summary
ColdVox is a modular Rust workspace implementing a real-time voice AI pipeline that captures audio, detects voice activity, transcribes speech to text, and injects the transcribed text into the active application with high accuracy and low latency.

## Vision Statement
Create a robust, cross-platform voice-to-text solution that enables seamless real-time transcription and injection with minimal user friction, supporting offline operation and adaptive strategies for maximum reliability across diverse environments.

## Core Value Proposition
ColdVox provides a complete voice AI pipeline that:
- Captures audio in real-time with low latency
- Accurately detects speech activity to minimize processing
- Transcribes speech to text with high accuracy using offline-capable engines
- Injects transcribed text into target applications using adaptive platform-specific strategies
- Operates reliably across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments
- Supports extensibility through a modular architecture

## Key Objectives
1. **Real-time Performance**: Maintain audio processing latency under 50ms from capture to injection
2. **High Accuracy**: Achieve <10% word error rate for speech-to-text transcription
3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Provide consistent functionality across major desktop operating systems
4. **Reliability**: Implement automatic recovery mechanisms and graceful degradation
5. **Extensibility**: Enable easy addition of new VAD engines, STT engines, and injection backends
6. **User Experience**: Minimize setup complexity and maximize success rates for text injection

## Success Metrics
- Audio processing pipeline latency: <50ms
- Voice activity detection accuracy: >95%
- Speech-to-text word error rate: <10%
- Text injection success rate: >99%
- Application uptime: >99.9%
- Cross-platform feature parity: 100%

## Target Users
- Developers needing voice-to-text capabilities in their applications
- End users requiring hands-free text input
- Accessibility-focused users who benefit from voice input
- Researchers working with real-time audio processing pipelines

## Technical Approach
ColdVox employs a modular, event-driven architecture built as a Rust workspace with clearly separated concerns:
- **Input Layer**: Real-time audio capture using CPAL with dedicated OS thread
- **Processing Layer**: VAD-gated speech-to-text pipeline with lock-free communication
- **Output Layer**: Adaptive text injection with multiple backend strategies
- **Infrastructure**: Centralized state management, error handling, and telemetry

## Competitive Advantages
- **Hybrid Threading Model**: Dedicated real-time thread for audio capture prevents priority inversion
- **Adaptive Injection Strategy**: Learns from past attempts to optimize injection success rates
- **Offline Capability**: Vosk-based STT engine works without internet connectivity
- **Platform Awareness**: Build-time detection enables optimal backend selection
- **Lock-free Communication**: rtrb ring buffer ensures efficient inter-thread data transfer
