## 1. üß≠ PROJECT IDENTITY & PURPOSE

### Confirmed Facts
- **Official Purpose**: ColdVox is a modular Rust workspace providing real-time audio capture, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Speech-to-Text (STT) transcription, and cross-platform text injection. (Confirmed in `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`)
- **Core Architecture**: Audio pipeline captures audio ‚Üí VAD detects speech ‚Üí STT transcribes ‚Üí Text injection inputs transcribed text into active applications. (Confirmed in `crates/app/src/main.rs` and `CLAUDE.md`)
- **Technology Stack**: Pure Rust implementation with optional Vosk STT integration, no Python dependencies for core functionality. (Confirmed in `Cargo.toml` files)

### Strong Inferences
- **Target Users**: Linux power users and developers who want offline, privacy-focused voice input without cloud dependencies. The presence of multiple injection backends (AT-SPI, ydotool, kdotool) suggests targeting desktop Linux users with various window managers. (Inferred from platform-specific build configurations in `crates/app/build.rs`)
- **Value Proposition**: Complete offline voice-to-text pipeline with local processing, eliminating cloud dependency for privacy-conscious users. The modular design allows users to opt into only needed components. (Inferred from feature flags and optional STT)

### Strategic Guesses
- **Market Positioning**: Niche player in the "offline voice assistant" space, competing with cloud-based solutions like Google Assistant or Alexa for users prioritizing privacy over convenience.
- **Evolution Path**: Started as audio processing pipeline, evolved to include text injection for practical desktop integration.

**Confidence Score**: High (90%) - Core purpose clearly documented and confirmed through code analysis.
