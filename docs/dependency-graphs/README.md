# Dependency Graphs

This directory contains automatically generated dependency graphs for the ColdVox workspace.

## Files

- `workspace-deps.*` - Shows dependencies between workspace crates only
  - `.dot` - GraphViz DOT format (source)
  - `.png` - PNG image format
  - `.svg` - SVG vector format
- `full-deps.*` - Shows all dependencies including external crates
  - `.dot` - GraphViz DOT format (source)
  - `.svg` - SVG vector format (PNG not generated due to size)

## Generation

These graphs are automatically regenerated by the CI pipeline on every push to the main branch using:

- `cargo-depgraph` - Rust dependency graph generator
- GraphViz `dot` - Graph rendering

## Viewing

- **In GitHub**: Click on the `.svg` files to view the graphs directly in the browser
- **Locally**: Open the `.png` or `.svg` files in any image viewer or browser
- **Raw DOT**: Use GraphViz tools to render the `.dot` files in other formats

## Manual Generation

To regenerate these graphs manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
cargo install cargo-depgraph
sudo apt-get install graphviz  # or equivalent for your OS

# Generate workspace-only dependency graph
cargo depgraph --workspace-only > docs/dependency-graphs/workspace-deps.dot
dot -Tpng docs/dependency-graphs/workspace-deps.dot -o docs/dependency-graphs/workspace-deps.png
dot -Tsvg docs/dependency-graphs/workspace-deps.dot -o docs/dependency-graphs/workspace-deps.svg

# Generate full dependency graph
cargo depgraph --all-deps > docs/dependency-graphs/full-deps.dot
# Generate SVG only for full deps (PNG would be too large for git)
dot -Tsvg docs/dependency-graphs/full-deps.dot -o docs/dependency-graphs/full-deps.svg
```
