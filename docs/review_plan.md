# Review Plan for Conclusion on Branch `anchor/oct-06-2025`

## Objective
Prepare to review the provided conclusion for the refactor-focused branch and identify areas where pushback may be warranted before sign-off.

## Step 1: Validate Stated Build and Test Results
- Re-run `cargo check --workspace` to confirm the build status and capture any warnings.
- Execute `cargo test` with focus on `crates/app/tests/settings_test.rs` to verify the reported failures about missing `config/default.toml`.
- Inspect test fixtures to see if the missing config file is an environment/setup issue or a regression caused by new code.

## Step 2: Audit Configuration System Claims
- Compare `config/default.toml`, `config/overrides.toml`, and the new loading logic in `crates/app/src/main.rs` and `crates/app/src/lib.rs` to ensure the documentation matches implementation.
- Check that the application fails gracefully when configuration files are absent, contradicting the claim that missing files are an "easy fix".
- Review `crates/app/tests/settings_test.rs` to judge whether the failure indicates a genuine product risk deserving pushback.

## Step 3: Review Text Injection Refactor Risks
- Examine `crates/coldvox-text-injection/src/manager.rs` and the new `clipboard_paste_injector.rs` for platform assumptions that could break existing functionality.
- Evaluate fallback logic for ydotool and ensure failure modes are surfaced; determine if additional testing or documentation is required before merge.

## Step 4: Cross-Check Documentation Assertions
- Verify that new documentation (`docs/deployment.md`, `docs/user/runflags.md`, `config/README.md`) correctly reflects available flags, environment variables, and configuration behavior.
- Confirm that the conclusion does not overstate the readiness of docs or omit gaps such as missing instructions for test setup.

## Step 5: Reassess Risk and Follow-Up Items
- Determine whether the conclusion underestimates the risk of broken tests in CI and deployment environments.
- Decide if blocking conditions (e.g., failing tests, missing config assets) warrant a "Needs Changes" stance despite the conclusion's optimism.

## Step 6: Prepare Pushback Points
- Draft targeted questions or required changes covering:
  - Ensuring test environments include necessary config fixtures or adjusting code to use embedded defaults.
  - Clarifying clipboard paste vs. ydotool priority and documenting platform limitations.
  - Resolving compiler warnings (unused mut, dead code) prior to merge.

## Step 7: Capture Findings
- As the review progresses, log discrepancies and confirmations to support a structured code review response.
- Maintain evidence (command outputs, code references) to justify any requested changes.
