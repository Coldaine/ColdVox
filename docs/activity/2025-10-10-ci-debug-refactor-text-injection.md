**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Branch**: `refactor/text-injection-consolidation`  
**Session Duration**: ~30 minutes  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Success - Code Fixed, Environment Issues Remain

## Executive Summary
Successfully debugged and fixed CI failures related to outdated Vosk library checksums. Identified additional environment dependency issues on the self-hosted runner that require infrastructure-level fixes.

## Initial State
- **Branch**: `refactor/text-injection-consolidation` (last updated Sept 19, 2025)
- **Current Branch**: Was on `dependabot-updates-2025-10-09`
- **CI Status**: Multiple failed runs visible in GitHub Actions
- **Last Known Issue**: Vosk model/library checksum verification failures

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Branch Switch & Investigation
**Action**: Switched to `refactor/text-injection-consolidation` branch  
**Command**: `git checkout refactor/text-injection-consolidation`  
**Result**: ‚úÖ Successfully switched to target branch

### 2. CI Failure Analysis - Initial Investigation
**Action**: Retrieved and analyzed recent CI run logs  
**Run ID**: 17861592026 (from ~21 days ago)  
**Key Findings**:
- Vosk model checksum verification was failing
- Error: `sha256sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match`
- File: `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip`
- Issue appeared in `scripts/ci/setup-vosk-cache.sh`

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
**Investigation Steps**:
1. Compared current branch with `main` branch
2. Found branch was 3 weeks old (Sept 19) and missing ~20 commits from main
3. Discovered main branch had improved CI setup with:
   - Retry logic for checksum failures
   - Better error handling (curl vs wget)
   - Model repo-first checking

**Root Cause Identified**:
- Branch was outdated and missing critical CI improvements from main
- Vosk library checksum in script didn't match upstream binary

### 4. Branch Merge
**Action**: Merged `main` into `refactor/text-injection-consolidation`  
**Command**: `git merge main -m "Merge main to get CI fixes and dependency updates"`  
**Result**: ‚úÖ Successful merge
**Files Changed**: 35 files changed, 1389 insertions(+), 521 deletions(-)
**Key Updates Received**:
- Updated CI scripts with retry logic
- Dependency updates from dependabot
- Improved Vosk setup procedures
- STT pipeline optimizations

### 5. First CI Run After Merge
**Action**: Pushed merge and triggered CI manually  
**Run ID**: 18414624683  
**Result**: ‚ùå Failed - Vosk Library Checksum Mismatch
**Specific Error**:
```
Expected: 25c3c27c63b505a682833f44a1bde99a48b1088f682b3325789a454990a13b46
Actual:   bbdc8ed85c43979f6443142889770ea95cbfbc56cffb5c5dcd73afa875c5fbb2
File:     vosk-linux-x86_64-0.3.45.zip
```

### 6. Checksum Fix
**Action**: Updated Vosk library checksum in CI script  
**File Modified**: `scripts/ci/setup-vosk-cache.sh`  
**Change**: Line 28, `LIB_SHA256` value updated to correct checksum
**Verification**: Downloaded library directly and computed sha256sum to confirm
**Commit**: `ab7069d` - "fix(ci): Update Vosk library checksum for v0.3.45"
**Result**: ‚úÖ Fix applied and committed

### 7. Second CI Run After Checksum Fix
**Action**: Pushed fix and triggered CI  
**Run ID**: 18414668108  
**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed Success
**Successes**:
- ‚úÖ Validate Workflow Definitions (12s)
- ‚úÖ Setup Vosk Dependencies (11s) - **FIXED!**
**Failures**:
- ‚ùå Text Injection Tests (46s)
- ‚ùå Build & Test (1.75) (36s)
- ‚ùå Build & Test (stable) (0s - didn't run)

### 8. Environment Dependency Analysis
**Action**: Analyzed new failures to identify missing dependencies  
**Findings**: Self-hosted runner missing required system dependencies:

**Missing Commands**:
- `pulseaudio` - Required for audio processing tests

**Missing Libraries (pkg-config)**:
- `at-spi-2.0` - AT-SPI (Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface) development package

**Impact**: These are infrastructure/runner provisioning issues, not code defects.

## Technical Details

### Vosk Library Checksum Issue
The Vosk library binary at version 0.3.45 was updated upstream, but the checksum in the CI script wasn't updated. This caused verification to fail even with retry logic.

**Resolution**: Updated `LIB_SHA256` in `scripts/ci/setup-vosk-cache.sh`:
```bash
# Old (incorrect):
LIB_SHA256="25c3c27c63b505a682833f44a1bde99a48b1088f682b3325789a454990a13b46"

# New (correct):
LIB_SHA256="bbdc8ed85c43979f6443142889770ea95cbfbc56cffb5c5dcd73afa875c5fbb2"
```

### Merge Statistics
```
Auto-merging: crates/coldvox-stt-vosk/src/model.rs
Files changed: 35
Insertions: 1389
Deletions: 521
New files: 7 (including symlinks in vendor/)
Strategy: ort (recursive merge)
```

### CI Workflow Trigger Configuration
The `ci.yml` workflow only triggers on:
- Push to: `main`, `release/*`, `feature/*`, `feat/*`, `fix/*`
- Pull requests to: `main`
- Manual dispatch: `workflow_dispatch`
- Schedule: Daily at midnight

**Note**: Branch name `refactor/text-injection-consolidation` doesn't match push patterns, requiring manual workflow dispatch.

## Outcomes

### ‚úÖ Successes
1. **Branch Updated**: Successfully merged 3 weeks of changes from main
2. **Vosk Setup Fixed**: Checksum issue resolved, Vosk dependencies now install correctly
3. **CI Improvements Gained**: Inherited retry logic and better error handling
4. **Root Cause Identified**: Pinpointed both code and environment issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Issues
1. **Environment Dependencies**: Runner missing `pulseaudio` and `at-spi-2.0-devel`
2. **Test Execution**: Text injection tests and build tests couldn't run due to environment

### üìã Not Addressed
1. Actual text injection refactoring code review
2. PR creation/reopening for this branch
3. Full CI passing state (blocked by environment)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Provision Self-Hosted Runner** ‚ö° CRITICAL
   - Install `pulseaudio` package
   - Install AT-SPI development libraries (`at-spi2-core-devel` or equivalent)
   - Verify all required dependencies from setup script
   ```bash
   # On Fedora/RHEL-based runner:
   sudo dnf install pulseaudio at-spi2-core-devel
   
   # On Ubuntu/Debian-based runner:
   sudo apt-get install pulseaudio libatspi2.0-dev
   ```

2. **Re-run CI** 
   - After runner provisioning, trigger another workflow run
   - Command: `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref refactor/text-injection-consolidation`

3. **Monitor Build**
   - Watch for any additional dependency or compilation issues
   - Verify text injection tests pass

### Medium Priority
4. **Review Branch Changes**
   - Examine the actual text injection refactoring code
   - Review files changed between this branch and main:
     - `crates/coldvox-text-injection/src/manager.rs` (401 lines changed)
     - New files: `backend_plan.rs`, `config_timeout.rs`
   - Validate refactoring goals are met

5. **Consider PR Strategy**
   - Decide whether to reopen PR #112 or create new one
   - Update PR description with recent changes
   - Address any merge conflicts or integration issues

### Lower Priority
6. **Branch Naming Convention**
   - Consider renaming to match CI trigger patterns (e.g., `feature/text-injection-consolidation`)
   - Or document why manual dispatch is preferred for this workflow

7. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update runner setup documentation with required dependencies
   - Document checksum update procedure for future Vosk updates

## Lessons Learned

1. **Upstream Binary Changes**: External dependencies like Vosk can have binary updates without version changes, requiring checksum updates.

2. **Branch Staleness**: 3-week-old branches can accumulate significant drift from main, especially during active development periods.

3. **CI Environment vs Code Issues**: Important to distinguish between:
   - Code defects (requiring code fixes)
   - Build system issues (requiring script updates)
   - Environment issues (requiring infrastructure changes)

4. **Manual Workflow Dispatch**: When branch naming doesn't match CI patterns, `workflow_dispatch` provides a good escape hatch.

5. **Iterative Debugging**: Multiple CI runs were necessary to isolate and fix layered issues:
   - Run 1: Identified outdated branch
   - Run 2: Discovered checksum mismatch
   - Run 3: Revealed environment dependencies

**CI Status**: Failed (environment dependencies)  
**Blocker**: Self-hosted runner missing `pulseaudio` and `at-spi-2.0-devel`

## Conclusion

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Success

The debugging session successfully:
- ‚úÖ Fixed code-level issues (Vosk checksum)
- ‚úÖ Updated branch with latest improvements
- ‚úÖ Identified environment blockers

However, **CI cannot pass** until the self-hosted runner is provisioned with required dependencies. This is an infrastructure task outside the scope of code changes.

**Recommendation**: Provision runner immediately to unblock CI and enable further development/testing on this branch.
