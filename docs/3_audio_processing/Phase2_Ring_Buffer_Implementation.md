# Phase 2: Ring Buffer Implementation

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Using rtrb library

## Implementation
ColdVox uses the `rtrb` (Real-Time Ring Buffer) library for lock-free audio buffering.

See: `src/audio/ring_buffer.rs` - Simple wrapper around rtrb::RingBuffer.

## Key Features
- Zero allocations in audio callback
- Lock-free SPSC (Single Producer, Single Consumer)
- Real-time guarantees for audio processing
- Producer/consumer split for separate threads

## Architecture
```rust
use rtrb::{Consumer, Producer, RingBuffer};

pub struct AudioRingBuffer {
    producer: Producer<i16>,
    consumer: Consumer<i16>,
}

// Split for thread-safe access
let (audio_producer, audio_consumer) = ring_buffer.split();
```

## Configuration
- Default capacity: 16384 * 4 samples (~4 seconds at 16kHz)
- Overflow handling: Log warnings, drop newest samples
- Used in: Audio capture → processing pipeline

## Migration Notes
The original design document described a custom lock-free ring buffer implementation. The project pragmatically chose the battle-tested `rtrb` library instead, which provides the same real-time guarantees with less implementation complexity.
