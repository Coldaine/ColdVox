# Dependency Review Plan

## Objective
Review all pinned dependencies in the ColdVox Rust project to determine if they are the newest release, and provide a summary report.

## Steps
1. **Extract Dependencies**: From all Cargo.toml files, extract all external dependencies and their version specifications.
2. **Identify Pinned Dependencies**: Determine which dependencies have exact version pins (e.g., "1.2.3" instead of "^1.2").
3. **Check Latest Versions**: For each pinned dependency, query the latest available version on crates.io.
4. **Compare Versions**: Compare current pinned version with latest version to identify outdated pins.
5. **Compile Summary**: Create a report summarizing all dependencies, their current versions, latest versions, and status.

## Identified Cargo.toml Files
- Root: Cargo.toml (workspace only)
- crates/app/Cargo.toml
- crates/coldvox-audio/Cargo.toml
- crates/coldvox-foundation/Cargo.toml
- crates/coldvox-gui/Cargo.toml
- crates/coldvox-stt/Cargo.toml
- crates/coldvox-stt-vosk/Cargo.toml
- crates/coldvox-telemetry/Cargo.toml
- crates/coldvox-text-injection/Cargo.toml
- crates/coldvox-vad-silero/Cargo.toml

## Preliminary Dependency List
(Will be populated after extraction)

## Tools to Use
- brave_web_search for checking latest versions on crates.io
- Context7 MCP server if needed for additional library information

## Expected Output
A markdown summary with:
- Dependency name
- Current pinned version
- Latest available version
- Status (up-to-date/outdated)
- Recommendation (if any)
