# [STT] Implement comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

**Priority:** High

## Problem Description
The STT pipeline lacks robust error recovery mechanisms, causing the entire system to fail when encountering transcription errors, network issues, or model loading failures. This results in poor user experience and system reliability issues.

## Impact
- **High**: System fails completely on transcription errors
- Poor user experience with unhandled failures
- No graceful degradation when STT engines fail
- Potential data loss during error conditions
- Difficult troubleshooting and debugging

## Reproduction Steps
1. Examine `crates/app/src/stt/processor.rs` - check error handling
2. Test with corrupted audio data
3. Simulate network failures during model loading
4. Check behavior when STT model files are missing
5. Monitor system behavior during resource exhaustion

## Expected Behavior
The system should:
- Gracefully handle STT transcription failures
- Implement fallback mechanisms when primary STT fails
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Continue processing with degraded functionality
- Automatically recover from transient failures
- Log detailed error information for debugging

## Current Behavior
The system fails catastrophically when:
- STT transcription encounters errors
- Model loading fails
- Audio processing errors occur
- Resource limitations are hit
- Network connectivity issues arise

## Proposed Solution
1. Implement comprehensive error handling in STT processor
2. Add fallback STT engines for error recovery
3. Create error recovery strategies for different failure types
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing components
5. Add error logging and monitoring capabilities

## Implementation Steps
1. Analyze current error handling patterns
2. Design error recovery state machine
3. Implement fallback STT engine selection
4. Add error classification and handling strategies
5. Create error recovery configuration options
6. Add comprehensive error logging and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Graceful handling of STT transcription failures
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for primary STT engine failures
- [ ] Automatic recovery from transient errors
- [ ] Meaningful error messages for users
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Configuration options for error recovery behavior

## Error Scenarios to Handle
- Model loading failures
- Transcription engine crashes
- Audio format incompatibilities
- Resource exhaustion (memory/CPU)
- Network connectivity issues
- Corrupted audio data
- STT model file corruption

## Recovery Strategies
- **Immediate Retry**: For transient failures
- **Fallback Engine**: Switch to alternative STT engine
- **Degraded Mode**: Continue with reduced functionality
- **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable failing components
- **User Notification**: Inform user of issues and recovery actions
