# EPIC-5: CI/CD and Developer Experience

## Description

This epic focuses on establishing the necessary infrastructure and tooling to ensure high code quality, detect issues early, and provide a smooth and efficient workflow for developers. This includes automating checks, managing test flakiness, preventing performance regressions, and organizing test data.

The requirements for this epic are derived from the specifications in `docs/plans/OpusTestInject2.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A flakiness detection system is in place to automatically identify and quarantine flaky tests.
- A performance regression detection system is integrated into the test suite to catch performance degradation early.
- A centralized test data library is created to manage and provide easy access to test audio files.
- The CI/CD pipeline is configured to run the appropriate test suites at the right time (e.g., fast tests on every push, hardware tests nightly).
- The developer setup is streamlined with a simple `make dev-setup` command.
