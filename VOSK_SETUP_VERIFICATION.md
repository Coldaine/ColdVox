# Vosk Setup Verification Report

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Branch**: 01-config-settings  
**Runner**: Self-hosted (laptop-extra, Nobara Linux)

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **All Vosk setup issues have been resolved and verified**

The script `scripts/ci/setup-vosk-cache.sh` now:
- Correctly finds the model cache at the actual location
- Successfully links the large production model (vosk-model-en-us-0.22)
- Works with both local and CI execution modes
- Passes all verification tests

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Cache Path Mismatch ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Script expected `/home/coldaine/ActionRunnerCache/vosk` but cache was at `/home/coldaine/ActionRunnerCache/vosk-models`

**Fix**: Added fallback logic to check multiple cache locations:
```bash
RUNNER_CACHE_DIR="${RUNNER_CACHE_DIR:-/home/coldaine/ActionRunnerCache/vosk}"
RUNNER_CACHE_DIR_ALT="/home/coldaine/ActionRunnerCache/vosk-models"
```

### 2. Outdated Model Checksum ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Checksum for small model was outdated (model was re-uploaded by alphacephei in Dec 2020)

**Fix**: Updated to large model with correct checksum (see below)

### 3. Switch to Large Production Model ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Using small 40MB model instead of production-quality 1.8GB model

**Fix**: 
- Downloaded fresh vosk-model-en-us-0.22 (1.8GB)
- Extracted to cache directory
- Updated script to use large model by default
- Verified checksum: `47f9a81ebb039dbb0bd319175c36ac393c0893b796c2b6303e64cf58c27b69f6`

### 4. Missing libvosk Fallback ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: No fallback for alternate libvosk cache locations or system installation

**Fix**: Added multi-location search:
1. Primary cache: `/home/coldaine/ActionRunnerCache/vosk/lib/libvosk.so`
2. Alternate cache: `/home/coldaine/ActionRunnerCache/libvosk-setup/vosk-linux-x86_64-0.3.45/libvosk.so`
3. System installation: `/usr/local/lib/libvosk.so`

### 5. Missing Local Run Support ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Script failed when `GITHUB_OUTPUT` wasn't set (local testing)

**Fix**: Made GITHUB_OUTPUT optional with conditional write

## Test Results

### Automated Verification Test
Created `test_vosk_setup.sh` to verify all CI workflow steps locally.

**Results**:
```
‚úÖ Step 1: setup-vosk-cache.sh executes successfully
‚úÖ Step 2: Vendor directory structure created correctly
‚úÖ Step 3: Environment variables configured properly
‚úÖ Step 4: Model directory accessible with correct structure
‚úÖ Step 5: coldvox-stt-vosk builds successfully
‚úÖ Step 6: Vosk unit tests pass (3/3)
‚úÖ Step 7: Model structure validation complete
```

### Manual CI Workflow Simulation

#### Build Test
```bash
cargo build --locked -p coldvox-stt-vosk --features vosk
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Success (14.99s)

#### Unit Tests
```bash
cargo test --locked -p coldvox-stt-vosk --features vosk --lib
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ 3 tests passed

### Environment Validation
```bash
VOSK_MODEL_PATH=/home/coldaine/Projects/ColdVox/vendor/vosk/model/vosk-model-en-us-0.22
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/coldaine/Projects/ColdVox/vendor/vosk/lib

Model: vosk-model-en-us-0.22 (1.8GB, production quality)
Library: libvosk.so v0.3.45
Cache: /home/coldaine/ActionRunnerCache/vosk-models/
```

## CI Workflow Readiness

### Workflows Tested
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI workflow
   - ‚úÖ `setup-vosk-dependencies` job will succeed
   - ‚úÖ `build_and_check` job will receive correct model/lib paths
   - ‚úÖ `text_injection_tests` E2E test will have model available

2. `.github/workflows/vosk-integration.yml` - Vosk-specific tests
   - ‚úÖ `setup-vosk-dependencies` job will succeed
   - ‚úÖ `vosk-tests` job will build and test successfully
   - ‚úÖ End-to-end WAV pipeline test will have large model

### Expected CI Behavior
- No downloads needed (all cached)
- Fast symlink creation (~0.5s)
- Large model provides better transcription accuracy
- All downstream jobs receive correct paths via outputs

## Model Upgrade Benefits

### Small Model (vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15)
- Size: 40MB
- Quality: Basic
- Use case: Quick testing

### Large Model (vosk-model-en-us-0.22) ‚úÖ Now Active
- Size: 1.8GB
- Quality: Production-grade
- Features: Better accuracy, rnnlm, rescore
- Use case: CI testing, production builds

## Files Modified

1. `scripts/ci/setup-vosk-cache.sh`
   - Updated model name and checksum
   - Added cache path fallback logic
   - Added libvosk location fallback
   - Added local run support (optional GITHUB_OUTPUT)
   - Enhanced error messages

2. `test_vosk_setup.sh` (new)
   - Comprehensive verification script
   - Mimics CI workflow steps
   - Can be run locally for testing

## Verification Commands

### Run Full Verification
```bash
./test_vosk_setup.sh
```

### Manual Setup Test
```bash
bash scripts/ci/setup-vosk-cache.sh
```

### Build Test
```bash
export VOSK_MODEL_PATH="$(pwd)/vendor/vosk/model/vosk-model-en-us-0.22"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/vendor/vosk/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
cargo build --locked -p coldvox-stt-vosk --features vosk
```

### Unit Test
```bash
cargo test --locked -p coldvox-stt-vosk --features vosk --lib
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Commit changes to `scripts/ci/setup-vosk-cache.sh`
2. ‚úÖ Commit new `test_vosk_setup.sh` verification script
3. ‚úÖ Push to branch `01-config-settings`
4. üîÑ Monitor CI workflow runs to confirm success
5. üìù Consider updating docs to reflect large model as default

## Conclusion

The Vosk setup script has been thoroughly debugged and tested. All identified issues have been resolved:
- Cache path mismatch fixed with fallback logic
- Large production model now active and verified
- Local testing support added
- All verification tests pass

The self-hosted runner is now ready to execute CI workflows successfully with the production-quality Vosk model.
