# ColdVox - Next Steps After PR #152

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-12  
**Context:** Post PR #152 (Text Injection Orchestrator) Merge  
**Priority:** Transition to UI Development Phase

---

## üéØ Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Merge PR #152 ‚úÖ
- **Status:** READY TO MERGE
- **Action:** Approve and merge `injection-orchestrator-lean` into `main`
- **Post-Merge:** Run full test suite in development environment to verify
  ```bash
  cargo check --workspace --all-targets --locked
  cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
  cargo test --workspace --locked
  ```

### 2. Create GitHub Issues üìù
Create the following issues to track identified problems:

#### Issue #159: ONNX Runtime Build Dependencies in Restricted Environments
**Title:** [Build] ONNX Runtime download fails in restricted CI/sandbox environments  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** `build`, `dependencies`, `ci`

**Description:**
```markdown
## Problem
The Silero VAD feature requires ONNX Runtime, which `ort-sys` attempts to download during build from `cdn.pyke.io`. This fails in restricted environments (CI, Docker, sandboxes) with no internet access.

## Error
```
Failed to GET https://cdn.pyke.io/0/pyke:ort-rs/ms@1.22.0/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tgz: 
io: failed to lookup address information: No address associated with hostname
```

## Impact
- Cannot build project in isolated environments
- Blocks automated testing and CI workflows
- Prevents reproducible builds in air-gapped setups

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Option A**: Make Silero VAD truly optional with feature flag
2. **Option B**: Pre-cache ONNX binaries in repository or CI artifacts
3. **Option C**: Add alternative VAD backend that doesn't require ONNX
4. **Option D**: Use system-installed ONNX runtime if available

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project builds successfully without internet access
- [ ] CI can build all feature combinations
- [ ] Documentation updated with build requirements
```

### 3. Triage Open Issues üîç
**Action:** Review all 20 open issues for:
- **Staleness:** Are they still relevant?
- **Priority:** Update P0/P1/P2 labels
- **Duplicates:** Consolidate similar issues
- **Closure:** Close issues that are no longer applicable

**High Priority Issues to Review First:**
- #136: Crazy enormous issue needs to be parceled out (already partially addressed)
- #46: Security - STT model loading validation
- #37: STT error recovery mechanisms
- #40: Platform-specific text injection testing

## üö¶ Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **ONNX Dependencies:** May block builds in CI
   - **Mitigation:** Pre-cache binaries, make Silero optional

2. **Platform Compatibility:** Text injection varies by DE/WM
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing matrix, fallback mechanisms

3. **Qt6 Availability:** Not available on all distros
   - **Mitigation:** Clear build requirements, detection logic

### Schedule Risks
1. **Scope Creep:** Feature requests may delay UI completion
   - **Mitigation:** Strict MVP definition, defer enhancements

2. **Testing Time:** Platform testing is time-intensive
   - **Mitigation:** Automate where possible, prioritize common platforms

### Resource Risks
1. **Solo Development:** Single developer workload
   - **Mitigation:** Clear priorities, incremental delivery, automate repetitive tasks
