# PR Summary: Issue Split Implementation

## What This PR Does

This PR addresses the requirement to **split a monolithic issue into separate, actionable issues** for the text-injection refactoring work. Instead of attempting to fix the problems (as instructed), it creates comprehensive templates for 20 separate GitHub issues.

## Problem Statement

The original issue described 20 distinct problems in the `crates/coldvox-text-injection` codebase:
- **P0 (7 issues)**: Correctness & reliability bugs
- **P1 (8 issues)**: Performance & maintainability improvements
- **P2 (5 issues)**: Structure, testing & documentation needs

These were all documented in a single issue, making it difficult to:
- Track progress on individual problems
- Assign work to different developers
- Review changes in focused PRs
- Prioritize effectively

## Solution Delivered

Created a complete issue management infrastructure in `issues-to-create/`:

### ðŸ“‹ Issue Templates (20 files)

Each template includes:
- âœ… Structured frontmatter (title, labels)
- âœ… Clear problem description
- âœ… Code examples showing current vs expected behavior
- âœ… Impact analysis
- âœ… Specific file locations
- âœ… Recommended solutions
- âœ… Related issue references

**Priority Distribution:**
- **P0**: 7 critical correctness issues
- **P1**: 8 performance/maintainability issues
- **P2**: 5 structure/testing/documentation issues

### ðŸ“š Documentation (4 files)

1. **README.md** (5.8 KB)
   - Overview of issue organization
   - Manual creation instructions
   - Issue list with summaries

2. **SUMMARY.md** (6.3 KB)
   - Detailed statistics and analysis
   - Work phases and effort estimates
   - Impact analysis and success metrics
   - Files affected and risk levels

3. **INDEX.md** (5.3 KB)
   - Quick reference table
   - Dependency graph (with Mermaid diagram)
   - Recommended work order by sprint
   - Label recommendations

4. **USAGE_GUIDE.md** (7.0 KB)
   - Step-by-step usage instructions
   - Three creation methods (automated, manual, API)
   - Project management guidance
   - Troubleshooting section

### ðŸ”§ Automation (1 file)

**create-issues.sh** (3.6 KB, executable)
- Automated bulk issue creation via GitHub CLI
- Dry-run mode for preview
- Extracts titles and labels from frontmatter
- Creates issues in priority order
- Provides summary statistics

**Total**: 25 files (20 templates + 5 docs/tools)

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
Every issue from the original analysis is documented with full context and actionable steps.

### 2. Dependency Tracking
Issues reference their dependencies, making it clear which work must be done first:
- P0-06 â†’ P0-02 â†’ P0-01 (app detection chain)
- P0-07 â†’ P1-12 (cache invalidation and cleanup)
- P1-08 â†’ P1-10 (duplicate functions and optimization)

### 3. Effort Estimation
SUMMARY.md provides:
- **Estimated effort**: 8-12 developer days total
- **Lines affected**: ~1000-1500 lines
- **Risk levels** for each issue
- **Testing requirements**

### 4. Multiple Creation Methods
- **Automated**: Run `./create-issues.sh` (requires GitHub CLI)
- **Manual**: Copy-paste from templates
- **API**: Use GitHub REST API programmatically

### 5. Project Management Ready
- Labels pre-defined (priority, type, component)
- Milestones suggested (Sprint 1-4)
- Work phases outlined
- Dependency graph included

## Usage

### Quick Start (Automated)
```bash
cd issues-to-create

# Preview what will be created
./create-issues.sh dry-run

# Create all issues
./create-issues.sh
```

### Manual Creation
1. Go to https://github.com/Coldaine/ColdVox/issues/new
2. Copy content from each P0-*.md, P1-*.md, P2-*.md file
3. Add suggested labels from frontmatter
4. Submit issue
